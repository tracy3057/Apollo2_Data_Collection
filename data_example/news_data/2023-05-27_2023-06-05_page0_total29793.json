A trial date of Aug. 15 was set. Ellenson has said Taylor wants to reach a plea agreement with prosecutors.\n\nThe felony neglect charge is punishable by up to five years in prison. The misdemeanor charge of recklessly storing a firearm is punishable by up to one year in jail. The boy will not be prosecuted.\n\nZwerner was shot in the hand and chest as she sat at a reading table in her first-grade classroom at Richneck Elementary. She spent nearly two weeks in the hospital, has had four surgeries and later told NBC she sometimes \"can't get up out of bed.\"\n\nZwerner filed a $40 million lawsuit that accuses school officials of gross negligence and of ignoring multiple warnings the day of the shooting. Zwerner's attorneys say school officials knew the boy \"had a history of random violence\" at school and at home, including an episode the year before when he \"strangled and choked\" his kindergarten teacher. The boy was sent to another school, but allowed his return for first grade this school year, Zwerner's lawsuit states.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Newport News School Board argues her injuries fall under the state's workers compensation act and cannot be addressed through her suit. The board pushed back against Zwerner's claims that the child should not have remained in her class, saying he was in the process of being evaluated and treated for possible ADHD \u2014 which causes inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Even if he had been found in need of additional services, state and federal laws would have applied \"for the purpose of keeping such children in the classroom with their peers when possible.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-mexico-police-reveal-beau-wilsons-arsenal-deadly-may-shooting-rampage", "https://www.foxnews.com/us/teen-adult-charged-pennsylvania-triple-homicide-face-death-penalty", "https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/virginia", "https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/drugs", "https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink", "https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/personal-freedoms/second-amendment", "http://video.foxnews.com/v/6319240474112"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": "3de6b08f9b6d4e8da835ed6cfef64da5", "name": "Bradford Betz"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "DEADLY MAY SHOOTING RAMPAGE", "weight": 0.07338248}, {"name": "prospective gun owners", "weight": 0.06417856}, {"name": "narcotic drug", "weight": 0.06211824}, {"name": "school officials", "weight": 0.06156064}, {"name": "federal law", "weight": 0.061106637}, {"name": "possible ADHD", "weight": 0.059776455}, {"name": "guilty pleas", "weight": 0.059651684}, {"name": "marijuana", "weight": 0.058415066}, {"name": "federal drug and gun charges", "weight": 0.058411654}, {"name": "federal gun, drug charges", "weight": 0.058411654}], "topics": [{"name": "Virginia"}], "categories": [{"name": "General"}], "entities": [{"data": "Virginia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Grafton", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "MEXICO", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Newport News", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Va.", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Deja Taylor", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 9}, {"data": "BEAU WILSON'S", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Jimmy Ellenson", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Abigail Zwerner", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "Winfree Firearms", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Fox News Digital", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Richneck Elementary", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "NBC", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "FOX NEWS APP", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "The Associated Press", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}], "companies": [], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.033282757, "negative": 0.45365822, "neutral": 0.5130591}, "summary": "Deja Taylor, the Virginia mom of a 6-year-old boy accused of shooting his elementary school teacher back in January, is now facing federal drug and gun charges.

The survival of many communities is at stake, as excessive heat, drought, or flooding could make them become unlivable. Last year, in Pakistan, we witnessed how floods displaced 30 million people while killing nearly 2,000. Air pollution may cause certain large metropolises to become \u201cuninhabitable\u201d by 2050.\n\nBiodiversity is rapidly declining. According to multiple studies, including the KNAW report, about a third of plants and up to 40% of animals are at risk of extinction, while around the same percentage of ecosystems is in jeopardy of collapse.\n\nCauses of decline in biodiversity include deforestation, unsustainable land use, and habitat destruction. The steep drop in biodiversity can have major repercussions for public health, whether by way of the impact on food supply or a disruption of ecosystem equilibrium. Also, climate change is facilitating the expansion of the range of some of the world\u2019s worst infectious diseases, such as malaria. Many diseases are migrating to places where they weren\u2019t prevalent before.\n\nIf these environmental changes continue unchecked, billions of people worldwide may face serious health risks by the end of this century. What\u2019s worse, the report concludes, climate change may ultimately be responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of people by the end of this century.\n\nThe Dutch KNAW isn\u2019t alone in its rather grim assessment. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), climate change is \u201cthe single biggest health threat facing humanity in the 21st century.\u201d As the WHO notes, climate change impacts the air we breathe, the food we eat, the water we drink, and the environment we live in.\n\nPlanetary Health was launched as a new scientific field in 2015. It focuses on the consequences of global environmental change for the \u201chealth and survival of all species living on earth.\u201d\n\nThe Dutch expert report presents the views of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences on the emerging field of Planetary Health. It identifies the main knowledge gaps and proposes a robust research agenda.\n\nAs a scientific program, Planetary Health is premised on the understanding that all life on earth is interconnected, as is the case with any ecosystem, large or small, and that safeguarding the health and survival of all species is a moral imperative.\n\nA better scientific understanding of the interconnectedness cited in the KNAW report may yield a greater awareness of the health risks associated with global environmental change. Importantly, this may also enable more effective policies aimed at altering energy consumption by key stakeholders and the carbon footprint they leave behind.\n\nPlanetary Health asks how nations can adapt to more frequent extreme weather events, the rise in sea levels, and and other climate change-related risks in order to avoid the concomitant negative health consequences. Here, Planetary Health recognizes that not all countries will be affected equally by climate change. High-income countries will likely be able to cope better than poor nations in managing the health effects of global environmental change in both the short and medium term.\n\nThere is pushback from climate change skeptics, especially regarding the degree to which humans are held culpable for global warming, but also just how much damage to the environment has been done. This isn\u2019t simply a reflection of societal polarization with respect to science and public health, or fringe climate change deniers claiming that the recent observed coherent global warming is merely part of a natural climate cycle.\n\nRather, there is a more sophisticated argument at hand, in which the causes of the problems we observe in the world\u2019s ecosystems are multifactorial. Take food supply, for example. The KNAW report and others like it point to increased frequency of temperature and precipitation extremes, as well as crop pest and disease risks as long-term threats to food security. Furthermore, as climate change accelerates this could intensify the dangers to crop yields to levels that can\u2019t be managed.\n\nBut, climate change doesn\u2019t have to be a \u201charbinger of global famine.\u201d In fact, food supply has apparently been increasing despite a changing climate. And, prior to 2018, there had been a decades-long marked decrease in the number of people dying globally in famines.\n\nThis decline in famine-related deaths, however, may be in danger of reversing soon as more than 345 million people are currently on the precipice of going hungry as they face very high levels of food insecurity. This constitutes a sharp increase of 200 million vulnerable people compared to pre-Covid-19 pandemic levels.\n\nClimate change is one of many factors that are giving rise to this increase. War, supply-chain issues, and the corresponding increase in food prices are contributing as well.\n\nHaving lived and worked in Europe for many years, I was invariably struck by the fact that climate change was a major headline in the news on an almost daily basis. And the environmental threat isn\u2019t merely seen in local terms. It\u2019s viewed as a global peril.\n\nIndeed, a survey showed that 93% of European Union citizens view climate change as a serious problem, and 78% see it as a very serious problem. In addition, 29% chose either climate change (18%), deterioration of nature (7%), or health problems due to pollution (4%) as the single most serious problem facing mankind.\n\nOn the other hand, in the U.S., global warming ranked 24th on a list of 29 issues that voters said they\u2019d think about when deciding whom to vote for last November. Only 30% of voters said they are \u201cvery worried\u201d about climate change and more than two-thirds said they \u201crarely\u201d or \u201cnever\u201d discuss the issue with family or friends. For these folks, ignorance is bliss, perhaps.\n\nThis may be due to America\u2019s insular character in some respects, as what happens globally matters less to many U.S. citizens. Moreover, it seems that many politicians in the U.S. aren\u2019t as prone to taking a long-term perspective when it comes to issues such as the climate.\n\nNevertheless, environmental activism appears to be winning the long game, if you will. Author, educator, and environmentalist Bill McKibben, for example, has been at the vanguard of the environmental movement since the 1980s. And for decades, the views of activists and scientists have influenced prominent lawmakers, but also policymakers in the executive branch of government, under multiple Administrations.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which President Biden signed into law in August 2022, contains plenty of climate provisions, all of which are informed by the consensus view among scientists that climate disruption is reaching crisis levels. Specifically, the law creates numerous financial incentives to encourage the growth of green industries and subsidize eco-friendly consumer purchases such as heat pumps and electric vehicles. The U.S. federal government will spend approximately $370 billion of IRA-sponsored funds to address climate change.\n\nBut whether this is a sufficient investment remains to be seen. Moreover, there is a large and vocal faction of legislators and presidential candidates who say they want to reverse course and repeal the climate legislation that\u2019s on the books. How much of this is political bluster is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nCan something be done?\n\nThe KNAW report isn\u2019t entirely pessimistic about the future. It says that fortunately many negative consequences of climate change can still be avoided if more measures are adopted in the short term.\n\nThroughout Europe a plethora of policy measures have already been implemented over the past few decades, which has led to decarbonization, a reduction in emissions and air pollution, and a series of pledges to invest heavily in clean energy and wean nations off of the need for fossil fuels. And now, with enactment of the IRA, the U.S. is making up for lost time.\n\nThe jury is out on whether technological adaptations, such as the transition to renewable energy, can turn the tide or whether a more drastic overhaul is necessary, such as a contraction of production and consumption (sometimes called \u201cde-growth\u201d). In any case, the KNAW report says that transformative changes will be necessary to the energy, transportation, manufacturing, agricultural and other core sectors of the economy.\n\nOvercoming food security issues, for instance, will require substantial public support for agricultural research and development to increase crop yields globally, adapt to ever-changing weather conditions, and reduce the land use and greenhouse gas emissions that derive from food production.\n\nAll stakeholders, from governments to the private sector to individual citizens, will have to fundamentally change their policies and behaviors to achieve sustainability. All things considered, society must overcome ingrained habits, and transcend vested, special interests with a view towards achieving a common purpose.

Trooper Anthony Nigro pleaded not guilty to first- and second-degree manslaughter at an arraignment in Buffalo, where the killing took place last year, and was released without bail. The charges in the death of James Huber, 38, are a rare example of a criminal case being brought against an officer by New York's attorney general, who has the authority to investigate the lethal use of force by law enforcement. The president of the union that represents Nigro defended him, saying the slaying was justified. TWO POLICE OFFICERS SHOT DURING RESIDENCE SEARCH IN NEW YORK The trooper's body camera video captured the fatal encounter on Feb. 12, 2022. Troopers first spotted Huber, a resident of North East, Pennsylvania, speeding on Interstate 90 near Buffalo and pursued him at speeds that topped 100 mph. The pursuing officers broke off the chase after Huber's vehicle exited the highway, but Nigro caught up to Huber on a street in downtown Buffalo and blocked his path with his cruiser. Body camera footage released by the state attorney general's office shows Nigro, a nearly 16-year veteran of the state police, holding his gun in front of him as he approaches the car. He orders Huber to get out, cursing at him. Huber turns away from the trooper and says, \"Go away,\" and then \"never,\" and \"nope\" as the trooper continues to yell at him to get out of the car, his gun just inches from the motorist's head. Huber puts his hand on the car's shifter, as if to put it in gear. The trooper yanks on the hood of Huber's sweatshirt, then fires two shots and falls to the ground as the car lurches backward, briefly dragging him. The car moved in reverse out of camera range, crashed and landed on its side on a parking ramp. The body camera footage shows Nigro running to the car. He radios, \"Driver's been hit.

Apparently, it's been a moment he's looked forward to.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"So I\u2019ve been waiting for this,\" Kelce said.  But he wasn't exactly able to finish that thought.  Mahomes was quick to whisk Kelce away from the microphones, and everyone on stage and in the crowd started laughing after the quarterback apologized for his favorite target's want to speak. CHIEFS MATRIARCH NORMA HUNT, WIDOW OF FOUNDER LAMAR HUNT, DEAD AT 85 Of course, Kelce is never afraid to say something into a microphone or camera lens. His \"You gotta fight for your right to party!\" line while celebrating the Chiefs' AFC Championship victory three years ago before winning Super Bowl LIV has become a rallying cry for the rabid fan base in the Midwest.  But Mahomes may have figured that Kelce's famous speeches wouldn't be appropriate for the White House stage considering he's been known to drop some expletives in the heat of the moment. Winning Super Bowls and going through championship parades can do that to a person.  Instead, President Biden and Chiefs head coach Andy Reid were the only ones to speak during the ceremony, with Biden going first.

The waters of Green Bay also are contaminated.\n\nRepublicans have already passed bills limiting the use of firefighting foam that contains PFAS but have resisted doing more amid concerns that clean-up, filtration upgrades and well reconstruction would cost tens of millions of dollars.\n\nThe state Department of Natural Resources last year adopted limits on PFAS in surface and drinking water and is currently working on limits in groundwater.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Tony Evers' state budget proposal included $107 million for PFAS testing and mitigation. Republicans who control the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee last month scrapped that plan and replaced it with a $125 million trust fund for dealing with PFAS. The new bill would create avenues for spending it. Key provisions in the measure include:\n\u2022 State Department of Natural Resources grants for local governments and public water utilities to test for PFAS; dispose of biosolids containing PFAs; and upgrade infrastructure and facilities. Owners of private polluted wells also could apply for grants.\n\u2022 The DNR would be prohibited from requiring owners of abandoned industrial property from testing for PFAS unless the agency has information that the property is contaminated. It would also bar the DNR from preventing or delaying a development project based on PFAS contamination unless the pollution poses a risk to public health, the project could further degrade the environment, or if the entity looking to complete the project caused the original contamination through negligence.\n\u2022 The DNR would need permission from private landowners to test their water for PFAS. The agency would be required to begin remedial actions at any contaminated site where the responsible party is unknown or can't pay for remediation.\n\u2022 A public water utility wouldn't need permission from state regulators to upgrade facilities if the cost is less than $2 million or 50% of the utility's operating expenses for the previous year and the move is in response to PFAS contamination that poses a public health concern.\n\u2022 The University of Wisconsin System and the DNR would have to collaborate on PFAS treatment studies.\n\nNo groups have registered in opposition to the bill, according to state Ethics Commission records. A host of organizations have registered as neutral. The Wisconsin Realtors Association and the Wisconsin Council of Religious and Independent Schools are the only groups that have registered in support.\n\nDemocrat Bob Wirch, a member of the Senate committee, said he was worried that a requirement for the grants to match up to 20% of the award would create burdens for small towns.\n\nHe also argued that the bill handcuffs the DNR, which would need more people to administer the grant programs. Evers' budget would have created 11 more agency positions to deal with PFAS, but Republicans erased that provision along with the rest of the governor's PFAS proposals.\n\n\"Putting the burden on the agency and not giving them enough staff people and then going after the agency for a bad job, we don\u2019t want to go through that scenario again,\" Wirch said.\n\nWISCONSIN LEGISLATOR SAYS PFAS POLLUTION IN STATE'S WATER SEEMS 'INSURMOUNTABLE'\n\nSen. Robert Cowles, one of the bill's chief Senate sponsors and chair of the Senate committee, countered that the DNR could ask the finance committee for additional positions at some point in the future.\n\nSara Welling, water and agriculture program director for environmental advocacy group Clean Wisconsin, praised the grant programs in the bill, saying they should help local governments with treatment upgrades. But she said the limitations on DNR testing are too onerous.\n\nLee Donahue, a town of Campbell supervisor, told the committee that the real solution is banning PFAS and that the DNR should be able to hold polluters responsible. She told a reporter that the bill focuses too much on large urban water systems and doesn't do enough to help towns like hers that rely solely on private wells for drinking water.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt was unclear when the Senate committee might vote on the bill.

SEC officials \u201cwere out prosecuting Kim Kardashian for promoting crypto on TV and social media,\u201d he says, while Binance was squirreling billions of dollars away on a business that spent half a decade operating with alleged disdain for U.S. rules, \u201cright under their noses.\u201d\n\nHill put some of the blame on a lack of alacrity on the SEC\u2019s part, but he also noted that existing American law does not really fit crypto.\n\nSpeaking about a litany of allegations in the complaint, he chalked them up to \u201cthe fact that we don't have rules of the road or a regulatory framework\u201d for the digital-assets industry.\n\nHill is a co-sponsor of a joint bill from the House Financial Services and Agriculture Committees that is meant to provide guidelines. The initial draft of the legislation only reflects Republican input, but congressional Democrats and the White House are aware of the key points, which Hill says will allow the current version to be a jumping-off point for discussions.\n\nThe lawmaker told Forbes that a major reason why this bill was not bipartisan from the start is that it did not have the same foundation of across-the-aisle support as stablecoin legislation, which was worked on jointly last fall by then Financial Services chair Maxine Waters (D-CA) and ranking member Patrick McHenry (R-NC).\n\nKey elements include pathways to registration for exchanges dealing in digital assets with the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which oversees crypto derivative markets such as bitcoin futures or ether options contracts, but under this bill would also be given authority over previously unregulated spot trading. \u201dWe wanted to live within the SEC and CFTC\u2019s frames of reference,\u201d says Hill. \u201cWe show a much clearer migration between something that starts out as a security could eventually trade over on a commodity based market.\u201d\n\nExchanges would have the option to register with the SEC as alternative trading systems (ATS). Such services are closer to the all-in-one model of trading that is common in the crypto world than to traditional national financial markets such as the New York Stock Exchange, which concerns itself mainly with transactions while brokerage, custody, settlement and clearing are undertaken by other participants. Gary Gensler, the SEC chairman, has reportedly been cool to the idea of letting crypto exchanges apply for ATS licenses.\n\nThe most contentious part of the bill is likely to be a section that lets registered exchanges issue an application to contend that a specific asset is sufficiently decentralized to fall outside of the definition of a security. According to the Howey Test, a framework based on a 90-year judicial precedent involving citrus groves in Florida, the level of concentration of power or ownership over a given project or its tokens could determine if the cryptocurrency is a security.\n\nIn adopting this approach, the bill is borrowing a self-certification strategy that has been a bedrock of the CFTC\u2019s approval process for new futures contracts. The House Agriculture Committee seems to be tackling the issue \u201cwith forms and processes that are familiar in the CFTC world and may be less familiar in the SEC world, says Christopher Giancarlo, former chair of the CFTC.\n\nHowever, it may not be quite as foreign as people think. Self-certification is \u201cnot an alien concept in the SEC when it comes to reviewing an S-1 for someone going public,\u201d says Hill.\n\nThis point is one of many key questions expected to be discussed at a timely hearing at 10 a.m. Washington time on Tuesday before the full House Agriculture Committee More important than the mechanics of the bill is the debate over if and when a token that began life as a security can become sufficiently decentralized to become something else.\n\nGiancarlo, one of the witnesses testifying at the hearing told Forbes that in his upcoming written testimony, \u201cI talk about the way the bill goes about confirming whether protocol is sufficiently decentralized or not. I think some of that needs some better refinement, and I imagine that both agencies are gonna have a lot to say about that.\u201d", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/06/05/sec-charges-binance-with-dodging-regulation-while-piling-up-billions-of-dollars/?sh=c8a70cd30da8"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": "f11909abbe804166a4fcf7a29b0cc7f4", "name": "Steven Ehrlich"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "crypto derivative markets", "weight": 0.07248774}, {"name": "crypto exchanges", "weight": 0.06545978}, {"name": "U.S. cryptocurrency regulation", "weight": 0.06337908}, {"name": "ATS licenses", "weight": 0.06180484}, {"name": "New Bill", "weight": 0.06116314}, {"name": "French Hill", "weight": 0.058942407}, {"name": "crypto", "weight": 0.058482386}, {"name": "traditional national financial markets", "weight": 0.05807451}, {"name": "U.S. rules", "weight": 0.05711714}, {"name": "new futures contracts", "weight": 0.056415737}], "topics": [{"name": "Cryptocurrency"}, {"name": "Binance"}], "categories": [{"name": "Tech"}, {"name": "Finance"}], "entities": [{"data": "House", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Binance", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "the Securities and Exchange Commission", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "SEC", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 8}, {"data": "Agriculture", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Hill", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Forbes", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Financial Services", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Commodity Futures Trading Commission", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "CFTC", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "the New York Stock Exchange", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "ATS", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "U.S.", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Arkansas", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "CA", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "NC", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Florida", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "French Hill", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Kim Kardashian", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Maxine Waters", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Patrick McHenry", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Gary Gensler", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Christopher Giancarlo", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Republican", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "American", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Democrats", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "D", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "-", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Howey Test", "type": "LAW", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "an S-1 for", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "10 a.m. Washington", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}], "companies": [{"id": "f1d2da9df02d4e0a93ca1f1bb263af62", "name": "Binance", "domains": ["binance.com"], "symbols": []}, {"id": "f667214998ae42f6bac70a3788810ca4", "name": "The Hill", "domains": ["thehill.com"], "symbols": []}, {"id": "3769381339454246b8a60789631119c7", "name": "Hellenic Exchanges - Athens Stock Exchange SA", "domains": ["athexgroup.gr"], "symbols": ["EXAE.AT"]}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.040431004, "negative": 0.055397715, "neutral": 0.9041713}, "summary": "A 136-page complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday illustrates much of what is wrong with U.S. cryptocurrency regulation.

You can never teach instincts,\u201d Max Scherzer said after working with Alvarez on Thursday. \u201cYou either have them or you don\u2019t. He\u2019s got that \u2018it factor\u2019 to him. He\u2019s got a good head on his shoulders, too, for being a young kid and wants to learn.\u201d\n\nNarvaez was an All-Star as recently as 2021.\n\nThe Mets signed the 31-year-old this offseason to a significant deal that guarantees him $8 million this year and comes with a player option for 2024.\n\nNarvaez, a lefty hitter who likely will see spot starts against righty starters, played in just five games before hurting his calf.\n\nHe might have been signed to be a regular, but the likelihood remains that Alvarez has won the bulk of the workload.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m ready to play,\u201d Narvaez said after the Mets were swept by the Blue Jays at Citi Field on Sunday. \u201cI feel like I can play every day. \u2026 I\u2019m not who is making the lineup.

But those fears have ebbed.", "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nFor months, U.S. officials said cross-border operations risked a dangerous escalation. But those fears have ebbed.\n\nDuring the first year of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, the Biden administration fretted constantly that if Kyiv hit back inside Russian borders, President Vladimir V. Putin would retaliate against not only Ukraine, but also possibly NATO and the West. But those fears have ebbed. As Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive edges closer, a series of bold attacks in Russia, from a swarm of drone attacks in Moscow to the shelling of towns in the Belgorod region bordering Ukraine and an incursion into the country using American-made armored vehicles, have been greeted by the Biden administration with the diplomatic equivalent of a shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to go out and investigate this,\u201d John F. Kirby, a National Security Council spokesman, said last week, in a reference to whether Ukraine or Ukrainian-backed groups were behind the attacks in Moscow. On Monday, fighters attacked at least 10 villages in the Belgorod region with heavy shelling, its governor said. Behind closed doors, senior administration officials have seemed even less fazed. \u201cLook, it\u2019s a war,\u201d one senior Pentagon official said last Thursday. \u201cThis is what happens in a war.\u201d\n\nAmerican officials view the cross-border attacks as preliminary operations for Ukraine\u2019s possibly unfolding counteroffensive, a sign that it will have multiple phases. The operations, they say, are an important test of Russian defenses and a flexing of muscles ahead of the big military push. That is a far cry from the administration\u2019s tiptoeing last year, when American officials took pains to make sure they were not giving Ukraine weaponry that could hit inside Russia, citing escalation fears. \u201cWe are not encouraging or enabling Ukraine to strike beyond its borders,\u201d President Biden said last May in a guest essay in The New York Times, just two months after he scuttled a European proposal to send MIG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that strike into Russia.\u201d Fast-forward 12 months, and Mr. Biden has signed off on sending Ukraine F-16s, an equally lethal fighter jet.\n\n\u201cI think the administration has really turned the corner to understanding that not only is Russia the strategic loser, but that they are very likely going to be the military loser,\u201d said Evelyn Farkas, the top Russia and Ukraine Pentagon official during the Obama administration and the executive director of the McCain Institute. Dr. Farkas said that the fears of escalation remain, but that \u201cwhile they are real, they are not as frightening as Russia somehow prevailing.\u201d American military officials say the reality of warfighting is that it makes no sense to constantly play defense and fight an enemy on one\u2019s territory alone, without putting a foe\u2019s own home at risk. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a war, you can\u2019t just sit back and give the initiative to the enemy,\u201d said Frederick B. Hodges, a retired lieutenant general and the former commanding general for U.S. Army forces in Europe. \u201cUnder the U.N. charter, every nation has the right to defend itself, so for Ukraine, from a legal standpoint and from a military standpoint, it makes great sense.\u201d Officially, Biden administration officials continue to say that they do not want Ukraine to use American-supplied weaponry to carry out attacks inside Russia, either by Ukrainian troops or paramilitary groups.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t encourage, we don\u2019t enable and we don\u2019t support strikes or attacks inside Russia,\u201d Mr. Kirby said on Monday at the White House. \u201cOur effort is to support them in their self-defense, in defending their territory, their sovereignty.\u201d U.S. officials say that while the threat of nuclear escalation is not gone, Ukraine\u2019s cross-border operations are not the type of action that is likely to provoke the use of a nuclear device. American intelligence officials have said they believe Russia would use a tactical nuclear device only if Mr. Putin\u2019s hold on power was threatened, its military began to completely collapse in Ukraine or it faced the loss of Crimea, which Russian forces seized in 2014.\n\nBut concerns remain that a miscalculation or mistake by pro-Ukrainian operations could transform a symbolic attack inside Russia into something more damaging, something that the Kremlin would feel it needed to respond to more strongly or that could generate tensions and disagreements among European allies opposed to any effort by Ukraine to expand the war, according to U.S. officials. U.S. officials also now say it is unlikely that Ukrainian attacks in Russia would prompt a Russian strike on a NATO country or facility. Mr. Putin wants to make sure the war does not spill over into other countries, which could prompt even greater U.S. involvement or spur the Biden administration to send armaments to the Ukrainians that it has been reluctant to give, for fear that they would use them inside Russia, the officials said.\n\nOf course, Mr. Biden has begun doing so anyway, from providing Ukraine with M1 Abrams tanks to the F-16s. Several current and former senior American, European and Ukrainian officials said the recent cross-border incursions by pro-Ukrainian forces into Russia and drone strikes around Moscow marked the beginning of Kyiv\u2019s long-planned counteroffensive. These preliminary attacks \u2014 what military analysts call shaping operations \u2014 are intended to disrupt Moscow\u2019s battle plans, pull Russian troops away from the main battlefields and undermine the Russian citizenry\u2019s confidence in the country\u2019s forces, the officials said in interviews. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the planned offensive. The attacks have escalated in recent weeks after strikes in Crimea and other parts of occupied Ukraine against Russian railways, supply lines, fuel depots and ammunition stores. Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington, Va., said the cross-border operations had two main objectives. \u201cThe first is to bring the war to Russia and show that it is not invulnerable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second is to get Russian forces to take seriously the problem of defending their border, and to get them to commit resources, perhaps pulling in troops from elsewhere.\u201d\n\nMr. Kofman added, \u201cThese types of operations are low cost relative to their strategic impact and effectively magnified by Ukrainian information operations.\u201d One of the last things Mr. Putin wants is to have the Russian public worried that the war could come to its doorstep, two officials said. But the Biden administration is walking a fine line. While administration officials urge Ukraine not to use U.S.-provided weapons to strike Russia on its own soil, they have also said it was up to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and his military commanders to decide how they will use that equipment. \u201cWe don\u2019t tell them where to strike. We don\u2019t tell them where not to strike,\u201d Mr. Kirby told reporters last week. \u201cWe don\u2019t tell them how to conduct their operations. We give them equipment. We give them training. We give them advice and counsel. Heck, we even do tabletop exercises with them to help them plan out what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/biden-ukraine-strategy.html"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": "40c1a47e5da44db0be5e374c465e33f0", "name": "Eric Schmitt"}, {"id": "18fcad905dab41eab5ffe5165a9d15ba", "name": "Helene Cooper"}, {"id": null, "name": "Julian E.

Economists had forecast a 2.0% decrease. Overtime pay showed weakness.\n\nNominal cash earnings increased 1.0% from the previous year, also weaker than analysts\u2019 expectation of a 1.8% gain.\n\nThe continued fall in voters\u2019 spending power comes at an awkward time for Kishida as he considers whether to call an early election. Sluggish payrolls won\u2019t help shore up support for Kishida and may force him to wait and see a little longer before he dissolves parliament.\n\nThe lack of strength in wages also suggests that the Bank of Japan still needs time before it considers adjusting its accommodative policy. Governor Kazuo Ueda has repeatedly maintained that the bank will continue with large-scale easing to achieve its 2% price goal in a sustainable and stable manner, along with wage increases.\n\nUeda also warned in a speech in mid-May that the cost of making premature policy adjustments is larger than that of waiting.\n\nApril\u2019s wage figures are discouraging, given the promising results of this year\u2019s salary negotiations. Japan\u2019s major labor unions and employers reached agreements to raise overall wages by a record 3.66% on average as of June 1, according to Rengo data.\n\nA separate report showed that Japan\u2019s households cut spending in April, an indication that higher prices are sapping consumers\u2019 spending appetite. Household outlays fell 4.4% from a year ago, compared with economists\u2019 view of a 2.4% decline.

But, her logic doesn\u2019t track.\n\nThe media was never really exploiting her body, but rather her position as the daughter of a Trump advisor. She was a pawn \u2014 underage partisan roadkill.\n\nIn 2020, she became the darling of some unscrupulous Trump resistance members masquerading as reporters when she started essentially livestreaming the domestic strife in her politically mixed family. In 2021, she was a contestant on \u201cAmerican Idol.\n\nThis latest move shows just how much social media and society has convinced young women that monetizing their sexuality for the web is somehow a gateway to emancipation and happiness.\n\nSexy subscription sites such as Playboy and OnlyFans and even platforms such as TikTok promise fame, financial freedom and girlboss status \u2014 if you\u2019re willing to get naked.\n\nAll one needs is good lighting, a bikini (if they\u2019re feeling modest) and a filter downloaded from the app store to iron out any flaw.\n\nBut just because pretty young things control the means of production, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re in control.\n\nWomen are still at the mercy of the customer base. Except now both their self worth and their net worth are directly tied to how others rate their aesthetic attributes. Do people like their body? Do they want to pay to look? Are they attractive enough?\n\nIt\u2019s a very tough place if you don\u2019t yet truly know yourself.\n\nSocial media is filled with celebrities, influencers and wannabe influencers showing off their private bits and attaching a message of self fulfillment and autonomy \u2014 the unbridled joy of expressing your femininity on your own terms.\n\nThere are also many plus sized women like Lizzo and Tess Holliday who show off their bodies as an act of defiance and a middle fiinger to traditional beauty standards.\n\nBut ultimately all of these women are conflating nakedness with empowerment.\n\nIf you really feel pretty and fulfilled, you don\u2019t need to incessantly post pictures for likes and validation.\n\nThat\u2019s not to argue for mandatory turtlenecks or burqas.\n\nWomen should feel free to express their sexuality, accentuate their assets and unapologetically lean into their sensuality.

How about the summer of blunt!\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s administration, under fire for leaving struggling farmers in the lurch with massive stockpiles of marijuana, plans on allowing the sale of weed and other cannabis products at farmers markets, festivals and concerts this summer.\n\nFarmers are sitting on 300,000 lbs. marijuana that is losing potency because of the slow rollout of opening state-licensed cannabis shops, with just 13 dispensary and delivery outlets open in the state to sell cannabis despite the approval of 215 licenses.\n\n\u201cFarmers would have the ability to get together and organize farmers markets in partnership with a retailer,\u201d John Kagia, the state Office of Cannabis Management\u2019s policy director said during a virtual \u201ctown hall\u201d meeting last week with members of the Cannabis Association of New York State.\n\nKagia said pot farmers and cannabis retailers could \u201cpiggyback on an event\u2026a concert, a festival, some other type of agricultural event\u2026. We would love for that to happen.\u201d\n\nDuring the meeting, state cannabis regulators told pot farmers and retailers they would even entertain selling weed on state property \u2014 such as the New York State Fairgrounds in Syracuse.\n\nThat raises the possibility that farmers\u2019 markets could be set up during music concerts and other events at venues on state and city owned property \u2014 such as Jones Beach Park, UBS Arena near Belmont Park, the Saratoga Performing Arts Center and Race Track or on New York City-owned property that includes the Mets Citi Field and Yankee stadium.\n\nBut the bailout for farmers could run into community opposition.\n\nUnder current law, cannabis sales are forbidden on government property, including parks.\n\nAlso, Nassau County and its municipalities have totally opted out of hosting cannabis retail stores. The UBS Arena and Belmont Park are both located in Nassau.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking very expansively about the types of places this can be done \u2026as long as we can get municipal approval to host these events,\u201d Kagia said.\n\nThe Office of Cannabis Management is still hammering out the rules for the pot farmers\u2019 market program, which could begin as early as July.\n\nOne minimum requirement is that at least three different farmers would have to team up with a cannabis retail licensee. All current taxes paid by the farmer\u2019s and cannabis store licensees would apply.\n\nCustomers can buy flowered product, pre-rolled joints and THC-infused edibles, but would not be allowed to smoke weed on the premises, regulators said.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be the first summer post-COVID. People are going to be back and out and about. We\u2019re already seeing very strong anticipated tourism numbers for New York this year,\u201d Kagia said.\n\n\u201cWhat a great opportunity to showcase this budding industry both to New Yorkers and the rest of the world in places they\u2019re going to be.\u201d\n\nOne Queen-based cannabis home delivery service operator is already in negotiations with 17 different farmers to sell weed at farmer\u2019s market events throughout the state.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re planning on doing a farmer\u2019s market every weekend from July through September. We\u2019re ready to go,\u201d said The Cannabis Place CEO Osbert Orduna, a disabled marine veteran and Iraq war veteran.\n\nNew York state lawmakers approved the sale of medical marijuana in 2014 and then gave the nod to cannabis sales for recreational use in 2021 \u2014 but only under a strict store licensing process that critics say is unnecessarily cumbersome.\n\nMeanwhile, a planned $200 million fund for \u201csocial equity\u201d for licensees that was supposed to help spur business openings, including $150 million in private investment, has been a bust.\n\nDuring the meeting with cannabis reps, state regulators admitted snafus have hobbled the budding industry.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of mistakes in the last six months in regards to ensuring we matched the canopy that was out there in the field with the shelf space that was coming on line,\u201d said Damian Fagon, OCM\u2019s chief executive officer.\n\nCultivators said they were hopeful the marijuana farmers market program would hope them unload their weed inventory and provide an infusion of revenue to keep them afloat, if not riding high, during the what has been a rock rollout.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great idea. If it works it will grain traction,\u201d said pot farmer Scott Trifulo. \u201cWe\u2019ll have our fingers crossed.\u201d", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/NYPICHPDPICT000010757764.jpg", "https://nypost.com/2023/06/04/pot-home-delivery-firm-taps-stoners-to-rate-weed/", "https://nypost.com/tag/marijuana/", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/NYPICHPDPICT000012224407.jpg", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/NYPICHPDPICT000010757763-1.jpg", "https://nypost.com/2023/06/02/one-party-rule-of-albany-is-both-comedy-and-tragedy/", "https://nypost.com/2023/05/11/ny-turns-to-medical-shops-to-sell-pot-farmers-fume-at-slow-rollout/", "https://nypost.com/2023/06/04/marine-vet-puts-military-logistics-to-work-with-launch-of-nyc-pot-home-delivery-service/", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/NYPICHPDPICT000010757772.jpg", "https://nypost.com/2022/12/01/chris-webber-throwing-up-air-balls-for-nys-legal-weed-fund-report/", "https://nypost.com/2021/03/31/gov-cuomo-signs-bill-legalizing-recreational-marijuana-in-ny/", "https://nypost.com/2023/06/04/pot-shot-ny-farmers-with-mounds-of-weed-fume-over-slow-shop-roll-out/", "https://youtu.be/Is9KM6lEhsk?t=2276"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": "c73a70eb80494b0c8d24eb00e1616ff4", "name": "Carl Campanile"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Iraq war veteran", "weight": 0.10303235}, {"name": "state cannabis regulators", "weight": 0.09317469}, {"name": "farmers markets", "weight": 0.09056967}, {"name": "NY farmers markets", "weight": 0.08580333}, {"name": "pot farmers", "weight": 0.08552365}, {"name": "New York state lawmakers", "weight": 0.084448524}, {"name": "state property", "weight": 0.08063163}, {"name": "cannabis sales", "weight": 0.07987449}, {"name": "pot farmer Scott Trifulo", "weight": 0.07974764}, {"name": "Farmers", "weight": 0.07866304}], "topics": [{"name": "Cannabis"}], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "Kathy Hochul", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "John Kagia", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Osbert Orduna", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Damian Fagon", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Scott Trifulo", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "NY", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Syracuse", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "New York City", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Nassau County", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Queen", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Iraq", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Office of Cannabis Management\u2019s", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "the Cannabis Association of New York State", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Mets", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Yankee", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "OCM", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the New York State Fairgrounds", "type": "FAC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Jones Beach Park", "type": "FAC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "UBS Arena", "type": "FAC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Belmont Park", "type": "FAC", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "the Saratoga Performing Arts Center", "type": "FAC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Race Track", "type": "FAC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Citi Field", "type": "FAC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "New Yorkers", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}], "companies": [], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.031655338, "negative": 0.31490472, "neutral": 0.6534399}, "summary": "Gov.

With its ranks comprised of actuaries, and its tracking of morbidity and mortality rates as cornerstones of the business, insurance company products have long been predicated upon developing and analyzing vast repositories of data to predict life expectancies, anticipate health conditions, and provide financial protection.\n\nWith the advance of rapidly emerging machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities, it is now possible to capture and analyze data, and predict outcomes, with far greater precision. It is against this backdrop that long standing insurance industry pioneer Prudential Financial recognizes an opportunity to disrupt a traditional legacy business. A senior Prudential executive poses the question, \u201cHow does a 150-year-old insurance company pull an Amazon? Can we take an internal capability and turn it into a revenue-generating business?\u201d.\n\nFounded in Newark, NJ in 1875, Prudential Financial is a Fortune 100 (#55) and Global 100 (#85) company which provides insurance, retirement planning, and investment management products and services to consumers and institutions across 40 countries. Originally named The Widows and Orphans Friendly Society, then the Prudential Friendly Society, Prudential is today the largest insurance provider in the United States with $1.4 trillion in total assets. Known to generations of customers for its Rock of Gibraltar logo, the company\u2019s slogans \"Get a Piece of the Rock\" and \"Strength of Gibraltar\" are still widely identifiable with Prudential.\n\nSpearheading Prudential\u2019s data and AI-driven disruption and transformation initiative is Kjersten Moody, who was hired in June 2020 as the 150-year-old firm\u2019s inaugural Chief Data Officer. Moody had previously served as the inaugural Chief Data and Analytics Officer for State Farm, a position she held for 3 years, exceeding the average industry tenure for a CDO of 18-24 months. Before that, she held leadership positions in data and technology with Unilever and Thomson Reuters. In her role with Prudential, Moody is responsible for the company\u2019s data platform, data automation, AI and ML, and data governance functions. In this capacity she works closely with each of the company\u2019s business lines.\n\nMoody characterizes the data and AI transformation efforts at Prudential as an effort to \u201cmeet the customer where they are\u201d and lower the perceived barriers to life insurance, like medical exams. She explains, \u201cWith our latest endeavor, we are working with our customers to refocus our planning on longevity, as opposed to the traditional insurance mindset of mortality, and in doing so, deliver a highly personalized approach to retirement planning and health and wellness\u201d. Moody describes this as \u201ca different vantage point for the customer, focused on how you are going to live\u201d.\n\nAs an example of the AI-driven transformation that has been underway within Prudential, Moody cites the rollout of a new underwriting process using AI to replace legacy, rules-based underwriting. This use of AI increases the speed and flexibility of the analysis, resulting in a 98-99% accuracy rate in forecasting longevity. This increase in speed and accuracy contrasts with traditional industry accuracy averages in the 75% range. The ability to apply AI and advanced machine learning approaches has reduced underwriting time \u201cfrom 22 days to 22 seconds\u201d and eliminated the need for laborious physical exams.\n\nIt is from these disruptive initiatives that in 2022 Prudential Financial launched a new independent venture known as High Peak, which is a Fintech/Insurtech start-up incubated from within Prudential with financial backing of the firm. Moody is a co-founder and currently serving as the entity\u2019s interim Chief Executive Officer, not the typical opportunity for an industry Chief Data and Analytics Officer. She is currently recruiting her successor as CEO, as she focuses on her full transformation mandate.\n\nHigh Peak\u2019s first product is called Acusite and is an AI-driven longevity model that originates from Prudential\u2019s use of machine learning and AI to innovate and transform its underwriting processes. Acusite is now being licensed by High Peak to provide other organizations outside of Prudential with the same insights into customer longevity estimates. The product is differentiated by a data set that is 3x larger than traditional longevity models, which enables it to predict lifespans with much greater accuracy, resulting in applications across industries:\n\u2022 Faster, more accurate, and more cost-effective policy decisions with fewer customer inputs, for insurance.\n\u2022 An exponentially richer and more personalized plan for customers by looking at a spectrum of risk categories, for financial planning.\n\nThe ambition of High Peak, says Moody, is to deliver value to new industries and audiences for Prudential, something she describes as an \u201cextension of the data value stream\u201d. Moody continues, \u201cThis is the result of more than 6 years of research and development efforts to leverage the depth of our data around application history and claims. We learned that we could do things with a high degree of accuracy and speed at a very low cost in a way that changes the customer and the human experience. The result is a simplified and easier process for buying insurance, critical for online purchasers.\u201d\n\nMoody summarizes the transformation which has taken place within Prudential: \u201cAI is the differentiator. It brings exponential value and speed to legacy processes\u201d.
