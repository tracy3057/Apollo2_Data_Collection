However, sales were below the 5.2% rise in April.\n\nMay's retail sales growth was the slowest since the 1.6% recorded in October 2022 when consumers cut back on purchases as inflation soared to a 41-year high of 11.1%. The BRC data is not adjusted for inflation, so May's sales growth reflects a fall in the volume of goods purchased.\n\nFood was almost the only area where consumers spent more last month, due to higher prices as well as celebrations to mark the coronation of King Charles.\n\n\"The wild card for the retail sector remains uncontrollable food inflation, which shows little sign of coming down in the near future, and this is having a significant knock-on effect on non-essential spending,\" said Paul Martin, UK head of retail at accountants KPMG, who sponsor the data.\n\nOfficial figures showed consumer price inflation fell less than expected in April, while food price inflation remained near a 46-year high at 19.1%, raising markets' bets that interest rates will peak at 5.5% later this year.\n\nThe Bank of England, which is expected to increase Bank Rate to 4.75% from 4.5% on June 22, has said it will keep raising interest rates if inflation looks persistent.\n\nThe BRC said retail sales in May were 3.7% higher on the year on a like-for-like basis - a measure favoured by equity analysts which adjusts for changes in retail space, down from 5.2% growth in April.\n\nSeparate figures from Barclays on Tuesday also showed high inflation and rising food prices continued to eat away at consumers' spending power.\n\nBarclays said consumer spending on payment cards rose by 3.6% year-on-year in May, of which spending on groceries increased 8.9%, the highest growth in the category since February 2021 when it stood at 27.0%.\n\n\"Although the latest headline figures show that inflation has fallen due to lower energy prices, the prices of core services and goods remain stubbornly high and continue to constrain real household disposable income and spending,\" Barclays economist Silvia Ardagna said.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": "b6d5cdecb67d44cd9efd9571fe1ef21a", "name": "Suban Abdulla"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "food price inflation", "weight": 0.11245751}, {"name": "consumer price inflation", "weight": 0.1100147}, {"name": "high inflation", "weight": 0.1002185}, {"name": "rising food prices", "weight": 0.096952}, {"name": "higher prices", "weight": 0.096124746}, {"name": "soaring food prices", "weight": 0.09536755}, {"name": "uncontrollable food inflation", "weight": 0.09495466}, {"name": "non-essential spending", "weight": 0.09462497}, {"name": "consumer spending", "weight": 0.09453613}, {"name": "inflation", "weight": 0.08175063}], "topics": [{"name": "United Kingdom"}, {"name": "Inflation"}], "categories": [{"name": "World"}, {"name": "Finance"}], "entities": [{"data": "UK", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "LONDON", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Reuters", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the British Retail Consortium", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "BRC", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "KPMG", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Barclays", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "British", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Charles", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Paul Martin", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Silvia Ardagna", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}], "companies": [{"id": "139c8f4d6a7645788a85706f4c832857", "name": "BRC Inc.", "domains": ["blackriflecoffee.com"], "symbols": ["BRCC"]}, {"id": "5f5e6141564246a384958e63945097b8", "name": "Bank of England", "domains": ["bankofengland.co.uk"], "symbols": []}, {"id": "05fe98551ba9452f8acc81d95645d530", "name": "Barclays PLC", "domains": ["home.barclays"], "symbols": ["BARC.L", "BARC.SW", "BCS", "BCY.DE"]}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.04104961, "negative": 0.9462215, "neutral": 0.012729001}, "summary": "The British Retail Consortium reported that British retail sales growth slowed to a seven-month low in May due to rising food prices and low hopes of a boost from three public holidays.

Warner Bros. Discovery now has to try to salvage Licht's tenure as chief executive.", "content": "Former television producer Chris Licht, shown here at an event in New York in 2019, faces an uncertain future at CNN.\n\nCNN Chairman Chris Licht is trying to win back the support of his troops following a disastrous magazine piece about his first year at the network.\n\nLicht expressed regret Monday to staffers about the Atlantic profile by journalist Tim Alberta, described by many media industry longtimers as an unusually damaging story about a prominent media executive.\n\nThe piece comes after a tumultuous period for CNN under Licht\u2019s tenure that has been marked by cost-cutting pressures, programming missteps and declining audiences.\n\nExecutives and employees throughout CNN and its Warner Bros. Discovery were outraged by the story, and the top conversation internally is how much longer Licht can last in the job, according to several insiders who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nLicht gave unfettered access for the Atlantic article, considered an unusual decision in itself when a company or network is undergoing a makeover. In the story, Licht disparaged CNN coverage under his popular predecessor Jeff Zucker while appearing to be oddly obsessed with him.\n\nThe story \u2014 \u201cInside the Meltdown at CNN\u201d \u2014 also stated what many inside CNN say privately: that Licht has been an isolated leader primarily concerned with Warner Bros. Discovery Chief Executive David Zaslav\u2019s mandate that the network be more hospitable to Republicans and address his perceived need to restore trust with viewers.\n\nBased on his remarks he made at the network\u2019s morning meeting, Licht recognized the damage the piece has caused internally.\n\n\u201cTo those whose trust I\u2019ve lost, I will fight like hell to win it back, because you deserve a leader who will be in the trenches, fighting to ensure CNN remains the world\u2019s most trusted name in news,\u201d Licht said.\n\nSuch a slice of humble pie coming from a chief executive is rare and a strong indication of Licht\u2019s cloudy future at the network.\n\nThe drumbeats that Licht\u2019s days may be numbered were heightened by last week\u2019s announcement that Zaslav has dispatched one of his most trusted lieutenants, David Leavy, to serve as chief operating officer at CNN. He starts in the role on June 20.\n\nThe rationale for the move is that Leavy will handle business, operational and promotional activities across CNN, freeing Licht to focus on programming and editorial.\n\nBut the narrative circulating inside CNN is that Leavy will be getting working knowledge of the division so he could eventually take over in the event Licht cannot turn things around.\n\nLeavy\u2019s arrival is aimed at giving Warner Bros. Discovery time to figure out if Licht can be rescued, as Warner Bros. Discovery insiders believe Zaslav is loath to make another high-profile management change so soon. Warner Bros. Discovery wants to make that determination before the presidential campaign season \u2014 typically a strong period for CNN \u2014 gets into full swing.\n\nZaslav did issue a statement late last week after the Atlantic story, saying he still has confidence in Licht.\n\n\u201cCNN is a very important business for us, and, in fact, we believe that nothing we do is more important,\u201d Zaslav said in a statement. \u201cWe aspire to be the news organization most trusted by viewers globally. We set a high bar for ourselves and while we know that it will take time to complete the important work that\u2019s underway, we have great confidence in the progress that Chris and the team are making and share their conviction in the strategy.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Licht is now topping a growing list of issues that have plagued Zaslav since taking over as the big boss overseeing CNN, Warner Bros. film and TV studios and HBO.\n\nThe veteran executive has presided over layoffs of thousands of people.\n\nLate last month, the company stumbled during its rebrand of the streaming service HBO Max, changing the name to Max to appeal to heartland consumers turned off by the coastal elite appeal of HBO. But the new app infuriated Hollywood talent by lumping directors, writers and producers into a single generic category called \u201ccreators.\u201d\n\nDespite the show of support for Licht, Leavy is acting like an executive who will be deeply involved in all aspects of the network. He has already reached out to on-air talent at the network and the agents who represent them, according to several people who have been contacted.\n\nWhen Leavy talks with employees, he will likely hear about low morale under Licht\u2019s leadership, which they have privately complained about for months, according to several insiders. Their unhappiness can be reflected in the number of unflattering stories leaked about the company, something that happened rarely when Zucker was in charge.\n\nLeavy, 53, has no experience running a news organization but is familiar with Washington politics. Before joining Discovery in 2000, he worked as a press spokesman during the Clinton administration, including at the National Security Council, U.S. State Department and the White House.\n\nEven before the Leavy announcement, Warner Bros. Discovery management was already concerned with CNN\u2019s direction under Licht, who arrived in 2022 with a record as a successful TV producer thanks to his work on \u201cLate Show With Stephen Colbert,\u201d MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d and \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d During a CNN town hall with employees in March, Zaslav conceded that mistakes had been made.\n\nThe transition from executive producer to the chief executive of a nearly 4,000-person news organization has turned out to be perilously fraught.\n\nLicht, 51, entered the job facing a string of challenges that were not of his making, including a soft TV advertising market, the shrinking number of pay TV consumers and numerous rounds of layoffs and cost-cutting due to the parent company\u2019s enormous debt.\n\nBut Licht baffled people inside the company by choosing to make a new morning program his first priority when the network needed to bolster its prime-time lineup after losing its top-rated personality Chris Cuomo. \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d is often the least-watched show of the day and two of its three co-anchors have been moved off the program, including Don Lemon, who was fired following a backlash over making sexist remarks.\n\nLemon was delivering the kind of liberal commentary in prime time that made Zaslav unhappy. But Licht was told that moving Lemon to the morning, where the ability to banter spontaneously is a must, was not a good solution, according to one former CNN executive who was not authorized to comment.\n\nLemon faced a backlash over ill-advised comments about Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley being past her \u201cprime.\u201d\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery executives were also irked that Licht said there would be no layoffs at CNN following the closing of its short-lived streaming service. Licht was forced to make more personnel cuts.\n\nBut the network\u2019s troubles became a full-blown crisis following the May 10 town hall with former President Trump, who long ridiculed the network for being \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nThe town hall format was panned internally and externally, as Trump was able to play to cheering supporters in the New Hampshire audience and deliver falsehoods at a faster rate than moderator Kaitlan Collins could fact-check.\n\nVeteran CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour publicly denounced the decision to give Trump such a forum.\n\n\u201cMy management believes they did the right thing as service to the American people,\u201d Amanpour told an audience at Columbia Journalism School on May 18. \u201cI still respectfully disagree with allowing Donald Trump to appear in that particular format.\u201d\n\nLicht and the company defended the decision to feature the former president with a prime-time appearance because polls show him as the Republican frontrunner for the 2024 race for president.

In response, 20% of consumers said they were switching from products that had been downsized by manufacturers to instead buy in bulk.\n\nA separate survey from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) also found spending being squeezed by falling living standards, with no evidence that May\u2019s three bank holidays had provided a boost.\n\nEsme Harwood, a director at Barclays, said: \u201cConsumers are still paying close attention to their everyday spending, and we are seeing growing concerns around shrinkflation in the weekly shop.\n\n\u201cMany are having to forgo discretionary purchases to offset rising food prices, with clothing and restaurants most impacted.\u201d\n\nBarclays said consumer card spending grew by 3.6% year on year in May \u2013 less than half the latest inflation rate of 8.7% and lower than the 4.3% in April. Spending on non-essential items rose just 3% due to consumers cutting back to manage household bills, while spending on groceries rose by 8.9% \u2013 the highest rate of increase in more than two years.\n\nThe BRC reported a similar pattern. The retailers\u2019 lobby group said the value of sales was 3.9% higher in May than in the same month a year ago, but said once adjusted for inflation there had been a hefty drop in sales volumes.\n\nHelen Dickinson, the BRC chief executive, said: \u201cThe trio of bank holidays failed to get shoppers spending as sales growth slowed to its lowest level in six months. While food sales got a boost from the coronation weekend, this was not sustained for the rest of the month.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, growth in discretionary spend continued to tumble as the high cost of living squeezed households. There was cause for some optimism, however, as brighter weather at the end of the month led to a much-needed pickup in summer fashion sales, as well as gardening and DIY products.\u201d\n\nThe latest monthly health check of the UK\u2019s service sector said rising wages were pushing up business costs and prompting firms to raise prices.\n\nThe S&P/Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips) purchasing managers\u2019 survey found upward pressure on pay had not prevented strong growth for the sector last month, with the business activity index above 50 for a fourth month. Readings above 50 indicate an expanding sector.\n\nTim Moore, the economic indices director at S&P global market intelligence, which compiled the survey, said: \u201cIntense wage pressures continued across the service economy, despite a moderation in employment growth. Higher salary payments more than offset lower fuel costs, which meant that overall input price inflation edged up to its strongest for three months in May.\n\n\u201cAverage prices charged by service sector companies nonetheless increased at the second-weakest pace since August 2021 amid some reports of greater price resistance among clients.\u201d\n\nFresh data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) showed new car registrations rose by 16.7% in May to 145,204.\n\nWhile registrations remained 21% below their level in May 2019 \u2013 the last year before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 last month\u2019s increase marked the 10th increase in a row, the longest period of uninterrupted growth since 2015.\n\nMike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said: \u201cAfter the difficult, Covid-constrained supply issues of the last few years, it\u2019s good to see the new car market maintain its upward trend and the fact that growth is, increasingly, green growth is hugely encouraging.\u201d", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/28/cadbury-family-size-dairy-milk-bars-get-10-smaller-but-price-stays-the-same", "https://policies.google.com/terms", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/08/watch-out-for-hidden-shrinkflation-price-hikes-analysts-warn", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/24/cat-astrophe-whiskas-pet-food-creates-a-racket-over-shrinking-servings", "https://www.theguardian.com/help/privacy-policy", "https://policies.google.com/privacy"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": "54e16c1ef592468fb650f14c56024e49", "name": "Larry Elliott"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "last month", "weight": 0.09883945}, {"name": "sales growth", "weight": 0.09068095}, {"name": "strong growth", "weight": 0.08205481}, {"name": "uninterrupted growth", "weight": 0.081815675}, {"name": "green growth", "weight": 0.07995924}, {"name": "employment growth", "weight": 0.07893536}, {"name": "growth", "weight": 0.07852448}, {"name": "rising food prices", "weight": 0.078456596}, {"name": "year", "weight": 0.073236}, {"name": "overall input price inflation", "weight": 0.07262244}], "topics": [{"name": "United Kingdom"}], "categories": [{"name": "Business"}], "entities": [{"data": "UK", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Barclays", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "the British Retail Consortium", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "BRC", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "S&P", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "SMMT", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Esme Harwood", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Helen Dickinson", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Tim Moore", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Mike Hawes", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}], "companies": [{"id": "139c8f4d6a7645788a85706f4c832857", "name": "BRC Inc.", "domains": ["blackriflecoffee.com"], "symbols": ["BRCC"]}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.07079292, "negative": 0.9151475, "neutral": 0.014059579}, "summary": "UK shoppers are feeling the effects of food industry \u201cshrinkflation\u201d due to the UK\u2019s persistent cost of living crisis, with food prices up by almost 20% in the past year.

I\u2019m also one of the writers.\n\nNo one really knows what an Executive Producer does!\n\nQueen of Oz is such a brilliant idea, how did it come about?\n\nWell, the genesis of this project had nothing to do with myself or Jeff , we wrote it but it wasn't our idea. That credit goes to a Canadian producer called Borga Dorta who got in touch with me to say, \u2018I really love your work and I've got this idea about a minor member of a fictitious royal family, who gets sent over to Canada to become their Queen.\u2019 I really liked it, so we all worked up a treatment, went to Toronto and pitched it to Canadian TV studios.\n\nIt was called, wait for it, Queen Of Canada! While we were in a caf\u00e9 between meetings I said, \u2018You know what, I think this might be better situated to Australia. Plus, Queen of Oz is a much better title.\u2019 So that's how it came about. That's a very long winded way of saying it wasn't my idea. We\u2019re still waiting on hearing back from the Canadians but to be fair, they did say they usually take a long time to say yes\u2026.\n\nThe Queen of Oz is much better than Queen of Canada\u2026\n\nOh, Queen of Oz is great! I just love that title.\n\nWhere did you draw inspiration from (beyond the initial idea)?\n\nLike most fiction our imagination I guess. We had the premise then had to build the world she is in, and map out each character. We knew where we wanted to end so we worked backwards from there.\n\nSo tell me about Georgie, Australia's new Queen? What kind of person is she and does she actually evolve across the series?\n\nShe's a reluctant Queen as she really thought she was going to live out her life going to parties, not do much of anything or have any responsibility. So she gets a very rude awakening getting shipped off to Australia as their newly-crowned Queen. She's very difficult, very hard to work for and doesn't make it easy for anyone. She's spoilt, entitled and deeply unpleasant which of course makes her a great character to play. She does evolve somewhat over the series but at her core she\u2019s fun and she's anarchic. I think when you're playing someone like that, you don't need people to love her, you don't really need anyone to like her even, you just need them to laugh at her.\n\nIs there a moment or any scenes that you really love?\n\nSo many, because they carry the memories of when we were filming them and the ones that stay with you are inevitably the ones where everyone starts laughing! Especially memorable was Will (Mathew) in the last scene of the series but I can\u2019t say what happened because, well, spoilers!\n\nThere's one scene where I was laying into the character Zoe about bullying and every single take we just disintegrated, disintegrated! I just couldn\u2019t get the words right because I\u2019d decided at the last minute to make up a song and kept getting it wrong. I love the take we've used, but it's the only one where I say the right words and we've still had to use Jenna Owen laughing in it! I recorded it off the screen in the edit and sent it to her (that\u2019s a definite violation of my contract) and we both love it.\n\nHow does Georgie respond to Australia? And does her attitude towards Australia change at all?\n\nWell, Georgie's attitude to Australia was formed when she was sent to Canberra to go to boarding school when she was 13 and bullied relentlessly, so she doesn't come here with a whole host of great memories. However as in all shows, of course she's going to evolve and we wanted to make Australia itself a character. Her relationship to Australia really takes the place of the usual romcom, they start off hating each other and in the end, as it progresses, she has to come to love it because she's its Queen.\u2026 She's her Queen\u2026 Australia is a female.\n\nCan you tell me about her relationship with her brother Freddie?\n\nOh, Georgie's relationship with Freddie, it's sibling rivalry and it's never really got out of the nursery. They're just jibing with each other all the time and one-upping each other. He's always been the golden child and she's felt very much in his shadow. But they're just two eight-year-olds really. When they get together they bicker and snipe and it\u2019s not unusual to end in a full on scuffle. There is deep down of course that bond that ties them together.\n\nYou have a great Australian ensemble cast. Tell me a little bit about how it was working with them? We lucked out so much! The cast and crew are brilliant, lovely, friendly, welcoming, magnificent people! And the cherry on the cake for me, I was able to work with my brilliant friend Niky Wardley, who plays the absolute scene-stealing Anabel - Georgie\u2019s Lady-In-Waiting. Joyous.\n\nTell me more about your relationship with Niky?\n\nWe have a great friendship and met over 20 years ago in a play at the RSC (Royal Shakespeare Company) that funnily enough we went to Australia with and we\u2019ve become great friends ever since and I just love working with her. She\u2019s just brilliant and I really trust her judgment. We\u2019re on the same wavelength and there\u2019s just a kind shorthand that we\u2019ve always had.\n\nHow did you respond to seeing Swifts for the first time as your Australian Palace?\n\nYes, Macquarie House as we call it in the show, that was a coup! Walking into that location for the first time we were open mouthed because we did actually feel like we were filming The Crown! Absolutely sumptuous and I think this historic gem in the middle of Sydney works fantastically on screen.\n\nAnd all of it was filmed Australia?\n\nYes we were in Australia for all of it, I always think it can look a bit odd when you are clearly not where you are supposed to be, so there was never a question that it wasn\u2019t all going to be there.\n\nDid you like spending time there? Is there anything you miss about it?\n\nYes I loved being there for sure. We meet such a lot of great people and it\u2019s always good to have new friends in faraway places. I also miss the acai bowls!\n\nYou met her Majesty The Queen what was that like?\n\nI did! It was after the Royal Variety show when everyone lines up to shake hands. She was very gracious and engaged, no mean feat when you think of how many of us she had to meet.\n\nBy the end of the series how do you think Georgie feels about the country which she now calls home?\n\nI guess this country that she\u2019s been dragged to kicking and screaming offers her a sort of comfort. A new start. I like the idea that she\u2019s somewhere she feels displaced and doesn\u2019t like but knows she\u2019s going to have to stay. She\u2019s imperfect and she does make blunders and she does break royal protocol, so the idea going forward would be that her and Australia come to terms and accept each other.\n\nThe Aussies could realise that she is not as stuffy as the others and she realises that Australia is more accepting of her than Britain would ever be so there could be more of a coming together of Queen and country. Or could there? With the rising tide of Republicanism Georgie would have her work cut out.

And it's what gives Xi Jinping the confidence that he needs to risk war with the U.S. over Taiwan on the bet that the U.S. won't want to actually go after two different nuclear superpowers at the same time,\" he said.\n\n\"That's actually the focus of my foreign policy.\"\n\nRamaswamy further suggested forcing a split between the two U.S. rivals could prevent a much larger conflict \u2013 surmising that if the Western alliance in World War II had the prescience to drive a wedge between German Chancellor Adolf Hitler and Japanese Emperor Hirohito \u2013 the global order would have continued much differently and likely peaceably.\n\nWhen questioned on why he would consider offering Putin concessions involving Ukraine, Ramaswamy disagreed it was an act of channeling former United Kingdom Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain \u2013 famous for appeasing Hitler in hopes of averting World War II.\n\n\"Well, this is the equivalent of if we could go back and actually disrupt the German-Japan alliance. Boy, would we have wanted to do that at the time if we could,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a reverse maneuver of what [Richard] Nixon did with Mao [Zedong]. Mao was not some \u2026 paragon of democracy. I don't trust Putin any more than Nixon trusted Mao, except this time Putin is the new Mao: Disrupt that alliance.\"\n\nHe said such a move would, despite giving Russia some concessions, transform the global order from bilateral to trilateral \u2013 leaving no firm alliances between the three major nuclear powers, U.S., Russia and China.\n\nAs for allowing Putin to potentially take over the Donbass region of Ukraine or some other concession, Ramaswamy said any overture would be backed up by firm agreements to halt military exercises with China and other things the Russian leade wants.\n\n\"If he reneges, then we go back on the things that we said we would agree to give him, which is what we're saying is no Ukraine admission to NATO, freeze the current lines of control. That's a Korean War-style armistice agreement,\" he said.\n\n\"But if Putin reneges on that now, we're talking about a maximum pressure campaign in terms of economic sanctions.\"\n\nSuch concessions, he said, if enacted, would be part of the larger U.S. interest to prevent Russia or China from attaining top status over America on the global stage.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe also quipped that Putin appears to dislike being viewed as Xi's \"little brother\" in their current relationship.\n\nThe candidate also expounded on his plan to seek a \"total decoupling\" of Sino-American business relationships, enacting a federal ban on such until the Chinese Communist Party commits to and follows through with reforms.\n\n\"I'm talking about actual real measures No data theft, no intellectual property theft, no more turning our own companies into your geopolitical pawns to do your bidding, using lobbying,\" he said. \"I think it would have some short term economic consequences.

You cannot do it. Please continue.\"  Goldberg similarly shut down the audience after they booed New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, R., who joined the hosts on May 25.

The fact of the matter is when we look at the results of the last election, what we saw was not Jim Crow 2.0. What we saw was an actually record-breaking number of African Americans not only voting but also succeeding at the ballot box.\" Goldberg and co-host Sunny Hostin also pressed Scott on how Republicans were making progress on the issue of race. At one point, Goldberg walked over and put her arm around Hostin as Scott addressed them both, noting he had a diverse Senate staff as well. Scott added that he helped lower taxes in 2017 for people like his single mother by 73%.

Scott appeared to be enjoying himself on the show, playfully standing up to give a sermon of sorts at one point when Goldberg cut him off to go to commercial. In the next segment, Goldberg had the producer personally come on stage to tell Scott they had to cut for break. Scott sat for three segments and at one point criticized the hosts earlier for previous comments they made after he announced his campaign for president. Joy Behar, who wasn't present, had said Scott didn't understand systemic racism in remarks that drew a sharp rebuke from Scott and other conservatives. \"I\u2019m on the show because of the comments made frankly on this show that the only way for a young African American kid to be successful in this country is to be the exception and not the rule.

It appeared to be a small bureaucratic tweak. An easy change of branding for a government inheriting almost \u20ac3 trillion ($3.2 trillion) of debt that will curb spending on new policy initiatives. Instead it was a statement of intent by Italy\u2019s first female prime minister of her plan to introduce what some have dubbed a nationalist vision for corporate Italy \u2014 one that views dozens of state-owned companies as a way to cement power and drive change in the economy.\n\nFrom a \u20ac20 billion deal to buy Telecom Italia\u2019s network to the recent sale of a stake in ITA Airways and attempts to restrict the role of Chinese owners at Pirelli SpA, the Meloni government has already intervened in Italy Inc. The aim: to influence and reshape the country\u2019s long term industrial strategy and institutions. While Meloni is not the first Italian premier to intervene in state-owned companies \u2014 the outsider who came to power as leader of a small far-right party \u2014 is determined to secure control over strategic infrastructure.\n\nTop of her \u201cItaly First\u201d agenda is the creation of national champions in areas from energy to fashion and luxury and the launch of a sovereign wealth fund to finance them. But, the prime minister is engaged in a delicate balancing act, morphing from the populist campaigner \u2014 anti-immigrant, dismissive of LGBTQ rights and protective of Italian sovereignty \u2014 to pro-investor, steadfast in her support of Ukraine in its fight against Russia and navigating a right-wing coalition of vested interests.\n\nAs part of that shift, Meloni is overseeing complex financial deals which only go ahead with her approval, according to several people involved in the process, who asked not to be named. The deal to sell the ITA stake to Deutsche Lufthansa AG was effectively rubberstamped during discussions between Meloni and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the Group of 7 meeting in Japan in May, days before it was agreed.\n\nThere have been missteps. The most high profile was the mishandling of the changing of the guard at Enel, the energy group 24% owned by the state and critical to the success of corporate Italy. The appointment of a new chairman became tangled up in intense bargaining inside Meloni\u2019s coalition with the eventual outcome interpreted by some as a defeat for her. The move unnerved some investors worried about possible threats to the financial stability of the country.\n\nMeloni\u2019s greatest success to date is something that did not happen. Despite widespread predictions that the markets would react poorly to her election last September, Italy\u2019s infamous \u201cspread\u201d \u2014 the difference between Italian and German bond yields which is crucial to the sustainability of about \u20ac2.8 trillion of the country\u2019s debt \u2014 has remained virtually unchanged. \u201cEveryone was saying grasshoppers would have come, the stock market would have crashed,\u201d Meloni told Italian TV in a rare interview on Monday. \u201cBut now, the stock market is going well, the spread is lower than the previous government, hedge funds have stopped betting against Italy\u2019s public debt.\u201d\n\nHer plan for corporate Italy relies on keeping it that way, with public finances in check. By a fluke of timing \u2014 the positions are rotated every three years \u2014 Meloni has the chance to hand pick scores of like-minded people for senior roles at the top of key state assets. In theory such involvement would give her government a greater influence over everything from new energy contracts signed by Eni to job creation efforts or reducing debt in other sectors. A form of insurance, perhaps, that her policies will be carried through at a corporate level even if she loses power in a country where no post-war government has served a full five-year term. It also means moving politically towards the center, potentially ostracizing some of the right-wing voters \u2014 attracted by her relentless anti-immigrant messaging \u2014 who brought her to power.\n\n\u201cMeloni's nationalist narrative is demagogy aimed at pleasing her voters,\u201d said Laura Orlando, Italy managing partner at Herbert Smith Freehills global legal firm, \u201crather than designing a solid strategy to build Italian corporate giants.\u201d\n\nHer Brothers of Italy Party won just 26% of the vote, but is part of a right-wing coalition that controls both houses of parliament. Many believe disarray in the opposition and the survival instincts of her coalition partners could deliver Meloni a full term in power.\n\n\u201cMeloni is ultimately a national conservative and her politics involve pragmatic responses to external challenges,\u201d said Giovanni Orsina, director of the School of Government at Rome\u2019s Luiss University. \u201cShe has a good chance of staying the whole five-year term. And has the luck to be able to place her people in the corporate world. It is only natural that she should take advantage of it.\u201d\n\nThe team around Meloni \u2014 a hybrid of family and decade-long friends, plus technocrats who served in the governments of Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister \u2014 must now help her grapple with decisions that could define her time in power and Italy\u2019s place in the world.\n\nNone more so than relations with China. The government must decide by the end of the year whether to renew its involvement in the Belt and Road Initiative, China\u2019s investment pact designed to deepen economic ties with allies across the world. Italy is the only G-7 member country in the program and its 46-year-old leader \u2014 described by close supporters as assertive, self-aware and strategic \u2014 is under pressure to pick sides in the increasingly fraught rivalry between China and a US suspicious of Beijing\u2019s ambitions.\n\nFor Italian businesses which have invested in China or those with Chinese investors \u2014 ranging from Pirelli to Inter Milan football club \u2014 there is a fear of a backlash from Beijing if there is any abrupt move.\n\nThe China decision is a minefield, admitted one official on condition of anonymity. \u201cWe need to cut the agreement in a silent way, not to blow it in China\u2019s face,\u201d the official added. \u201cIt is impossible to think that we can avoid doing business with China.\u201d\n\nItaly joined the BRI in 2019, a decision made by a quirky government backed by both the populist Five Star Movement and Matteo Salvini \u2014 now a key member of Meloni\u2019s coalition and leader of the right-wing League. China\u2019s President Xi Jinping was welcomed to Rome to announce the agreement amid fanfare, but also criticism from the EU and US, worried about Italy\u2019s growing closeness to both China and Russia.\n\nThe government gambled that membership of the BRI would turn Italy into a gateway for Chinese investment into Europe. Yet, according to data compiled by Rhodium Group, Italy has not enjoyed as great an uptick in investment as it might have expected. Between 2000 and 2022, China invested about \u20ac16 billion in Italy, compared to \u20ac17 billion in France and \u20ac32 billion in Germany. Bank of Italy data show that China's direct investment stock into the country did not change significantly after 2019, hovering just under \u20ac5 billion annually until 2022. It does, however, remain a key destination for Italian exports \u2014 shipments to China rose above \u20ac7 billion during the first quarter of this year, further complicating Meloni\u2019s decision.\n\nA critic of the original BRI deal, the prime minister must now decide whether to allow it to automatically renew for another five years on Dec. 22 or opt out knowing that ending the agreement risks trade retaliation by Beijing and potentially her plans to reshape corporate Italy.\n\nAbout 2,000 Italian companies are active in China, according to the Italy-China Foundation, employing about 157,000 people and business worth \u20ac17 billion. Big industrial companies like shipbuilder Fincantieri and brakes-maker Brembo, plus some state-owned companies, could be at risk in any tit-for-tat backlash.\n\nItalian officials insist privately that its membership of the BRI will not be renewed. Meloni had been expected to use last month\u2019s G-7 summit in the Japanese city of Hiroshima to brief member states on Italy\u2019s position, but no decision has yet been made public.\n\n\"We still have time to think what to do on China's BRI,\" the prime minister told a press conference in Hiroshima. \u201cWhatever decision we will take will have consequences. You know what my opinion was, and I have not changed my mind about it. But conditions have changed.\u201d\n\nWith interest rates still edging higher across Europe and lackluster economic growth, it is becoming increasingly difficult to service Italy\u2019s debt, which stands at 145% of economic output amid mounting concern that the country\u2019s financial system remains over reliant on waning support from the European Central Bank. Meloni promised to protect Italians from hardship and rebuild the post-Covid-19 economy and the country cannot afford a conflict with a major trading partner.\n\nThat sentiment is acute within Italian business. At Singapore's Raffles Hotel in May several Italian executives met informally to discuss the impact of their government quitting the BRI. All asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from Beijing, but said they are lobbying the Meloni government to delay the decision. One executive, whose company has billions invested in China, said an exit this year will not allow businesses enough time to reduce their exposure to China, something several are slowly doing. Many fear being locked out of the Chinese market.\n\nGovernment advisers in Rome are investigating concessions to Beijing \u2014 from an easing of some import and export tariffs to trade deals and investments linked to specific sectors \u2014 to reduce the damage of any withdrawal.\n\n\u201cHow Meloni will solve her dilemma on Italy\u2019s role in the Belt and Road will be a watershed moment for her government,\u201d said Nathalie Tocci, director of the Istituto Affari Internazionali think-tank, and former board member of Eni SpA. \u201cShe used an unwavering support for Ukraine and to the US as a way to gain the trust of international partners\n\nMeloni\u2019s backing for Ukraine put her at odds with two of her key political allies: Berlusconi, a personal friend of Vladimir Putin, and Salvini who has said that Russia\u2019s president is a better leader than Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s former chancellor. Some compromises with Salvini have been easy \u2014 agreeing to build a bridge between Italy and Sicily, a plan which has been discussed since ancient Roman times \u2014 others have cost Meloni political capital.\n\nWhen she bowed to Salvini over the appointments at Enel, investors took note. Until April, Enel, Italy\u2019s biggest company valued at more than \u20ac60 billion, was led by Francesco Starace, brother of Italy\u2019s ambassador to Russia. Starace handled the company\u2019s exit from Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. But he was among a handful of executives to attend a business forum with Putin in February 2022, despite a government request not to.\n\nWhen he stepped down as Enel chief executive officer in April 2023 it sparked weeks of political manoeuvring that ended with Meloni locked in a room with Salvini and a handful of advisers to select his successor and a new board. The expectation was that the job would go to a Meloni ally. Instead, after several hours of negotiations Flavio Cattaneo, close to the League and Salvini, emerged as CEO and Paolo Scaroni as chairman. Picking old-school managers like Scaroni \u2014 with connections to Moscow and Berlusconi \u2014 angered some investors, many of whom believed the decision had weakened the prime minister.\n\nFollowing the surprise appointments, Enel shares fell by as much as 4.5%, but they have since recovered and are now trading around the same level they were 12 months ago.\n\nLondon-based Covalis Capital LLP challenged the appointment of Scaroni and accused the government of running an \u201copaque\u201d nomination process. While the one-month boardroom standoff ended with investors backing the prime minister the episode bruised her credibility and raised doubts over whether she will be able to force through changes at the top of other key state companies.\n\nSeveral corporate deals have also drawn close government attention. Meloni has come under pressure from the automotive lobby association to buy a stake in the Italian-French carmaker Stellantis to counter the influence of France, which owns 6% of the company.\n\nBut Giancarlo Giorgetti, Italy\u2019s finance minister, has dismissed any suggestion that the government would buy into the company. \u201cThe State should intervene only when the market fails or to protect strategic national interest,\u201d he told Bloomberg\u2019s Italy Capital Markets Forum on Monday.\n\nTelecom Italia has been the most contentious target. The former monopoly is at the center of negotiations over the sale of its network and the future role of its largest shareholder, French conglomerate Vivendi. While the government has repeatedly said it wants to keep control of the network, the structure of any deal is yet to emerge.\n\nNegotiators in Palazzo Chigi, the prime minister\u2019s official residence \u2014 ranging from Meloni's chief of staff to advisers and coalition ministers including Salvini \u2014 have discussed several scenarios. These could lead to Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA \u2014 which already owns a 9.8% stake \u2014 buying the assets, or a sale to US private equity firm KKR & Co. Despite the sovereignty concerns over selling to a US group, the KKR option could succeed if Cassa Depositi or a different government investment body takes a minority stake in order to safeguard Italian interests, according to people familiar with the ongoing talks.\n\n\u201cFor Meloni, a slew of highly political corporate appointments is a way to distribute power without being too caught up in the public debate,\u201d said Martina Carone, a political analyst at YouTrend. \u201cWhile the fate of companies worth billions is key for investors it is not closely followed by her right-wing electorate. Meloni seems stable, her opposition is in disarray.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut her strategy also has a risk,\u201d Carone added. \u201cIt is likely that when Meloni's perceived novelty loses its shine, tensions within her coalition will emerge and that could happen earlier than one might think.\u201d\n\n\u2014 With assistance by Giovanni Salzano, Alberto Brambilla, Jody Megson and Carla Canivete",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nKyiv has not formally announced the start of operations. But Russia said that major Ukrainian attacks had begun in the Donetsk region and that it had repelled the assaults and inflicted casualties.\n\nUkrainian forces have stepped up artillery strikes and ground assaults in a flurry of military activity that American officials suggested on Monday could signal that Kyiv\u2019s long-planned counteroffensive against Russia had begun. The fighting, which began on Sunday, was raging along several points on the front line, but farther to the east of where many analysts had expected Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive to launch. Even if it has started in that eastern area, experts said, the battle would allow Kyiv\u2019s troops to try to accomplish the same goal: Head south toward the Sea of Azov and cut off the land bridge connecting occupied Crimea to mainland Russia. The Russian Ministry of Defense said on Monday that a major Ukrainian operation had begun at five locations in the eastern Donetsk region and that it had repelled the assaults and inflicted casualties on Ukrainian forces. Moscow\u2019s account could not be independently corroborated. Ukraine\u2019s deputy minister of defense, Hanna Malyar, said on the Telegram messaging app that Kyiv\u2019s forces in some areas were \u201cmoving to offensive actions\u201d in the war that began when Russia invaded its neighbor 15 months ago. But she stopped short of saying it was a decisive new phase in the war.\n\nPro-Russian bloggers noted that a strong Ukrainian attack had begun Monday morning near the town of Velyka Novosilka, in Donetsk. Mikhail Zvinchuk, a pro-Russian blogger who writes under the pseudonym Rybar, described intense fighting as Ukrainian soldiers in German-made Leopard tanks seized control of the village of Novodonetske on Monday evening, a possible sign that Kyiv had pushed its NATO-trained forces into the battle. He said the battles were being contested \u201cunder heavy artillery fire.\u201d\n\nAleksandr Khodakovsky, the commander of a Russian proxy group, also described seeing Leopard tanks during the fighting near Novodonetske, where, he said, Ukrainian forces had \u201cfelt out our weak spots.\u201d President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, in his overnight address, expressed gratitude to \u201cto all our defenders who gave us the news we expect.\u201d \u201cWe see how hysterically Russia perceives every step we take there, every position we take,\u201d he added. \u201cThe enemy knows that Ukraine will win. They see it. They feel it thanks to your strikes, soldiers, and in particular in the Donetsk region.\u201d\n\nUkraine has long said it will make no formal announcement about the start of its counteroffensive. And Ukrainian officials have not told their American counterparts exactly when the battles will start, but provided them with a time frame for when they intended to begin the push against Russian forces. Sunday fell within that time frame, said U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence. The American officials based their assessment that Kyiv had most likely begun its counteroffensive partly on information from U.S. military satellites, which had detected increased movement from the Ukrainian military positions. The satellites have infrared capabilities to track artillery fire and missile launches. U.S. military analysts also said they believed that Ukrainian units had begun an initial push to determine the positions and strength of Russia\u2019s forces \u2014 a traditional tactic that Americans had been training Ukrainian forces to use. An American official said that testing for potential weaknesses in Russian defenses, manpower and morale \u2014 what the U.S. military calls \u201creconnaissance by force\u201d \u2014 would most likely continue for several days. If successful, the official said, the main thrust of the Ukrainian counteroffensive would become more evident during that time. U.S. and Ukrainian officials would also be watching closely to see how Russia reacts to these attacks spread out along the front lines.\n\nAt the White House, John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said he would not go beyond the statement that Ukrainian officials made. \u201cWhat I can speak to is how hard we worked to prepare them to be ready,\u201d Mr. Kirby said. \u201cThe president is confident we did everything we could over the last seven, eight months or more to make sure they had the capabilities to be successful.\u201d Much is riding on Kyiv\u2019s ability to reclaim territory lost to Russia since the war began. Ukrainian officials say they must move as quickly as possible to liberate people living under Russian occupation and subject to abuses, including torture and the forced deportation of children to Russia. Success could also support Ukraine\u2019s push for longer-term commitments from the West for additional military aid and security guarantees. It could also strengthen the hand of Mr. Zelensky in any peace talks with Russia. Failure, or a lack of demonstrably quick progress, could complicate Kyiv\u2019s push for additional security guarantees at a NATO summit this summer. The front line in southern and eastern Ukraine has been largely static for months, with the exception of intense fighting in the eastern city of Bakhmut and operations by small Ukrainian units. In northeastern Ukraine, anti-Kremlin forces have been staging cross-border raids into Russia since last month.\n\nOne difficulty in determining the exact start of a counteroffensive is that the fighting could begin with feints or diversions. And to carry out a successful counterattack after months of planning, Ukrainian troops must navigate mostly flat, unforgiving terrain and staunch Russian defenses. The operation is expected to involve thousands of Ukrainian troops, including many equipped with newer and more advanced Western equipment like armored personnel carriers and tanks. Western officials have long thought that a counteroffensive would focus on southern Ukraine as part of a strategy to sever the land bridge between western Russia and Crimea. But no matter where Ukraine attacks along a front line stretching hundreds of miles, Russia\u2019s defenses will be formidable. Moscow\u2019s forces have had months to dig in, lay minefields and prepare entrenchments. The Pentagon has trained new Ukrainian units with the hope that they have the power to turn the tide, but some American officials have noted that dug-in Russian defenders could prove difficult to dislodge.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/03/world/europe/belgorod-russia-ukraine-war.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/11/world/europe/ukraine-kharkiv-russian-retreat.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/05/world/russia-ukraine-news#a-ukrainian-counteroffensive-would-face-tough-terrain-and-dug-in-russian-troops", "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/22/world/europe/bakhmut-russia-ukraine-retreat.html"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": null, "name": "Julian E.

Mr. Tisius\u2019s lawyers had also argued that another juror from the sentencing trial was unable to read, a requirement under Missouri law for jury service.\n\n\u201cMissouri\u2019s judicial system provided Mr. Tisius with due process and fair proceedings for his brutal murders of two Randolph County jail guards,\u201d Mr. Parson said in a statement, adding, \u201cThe State of Missouri will carry out Mr. Tisius\u2019s sentences according to the court\u2019s order and deliver justice.\u201d\n\nMr. Parson, a Republican, said that Mr. Tisius\u2019s case \u201creceived fair and careful review at each step in the judicial process.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a stay of execution for Mr. Tisius, rejecting his lawyers\u2019 argument that his age at the time of the crime, 19, should spare him from the death penalty.

The rapper took to Twitter on Monday (June 5) to reveal that her upcoming full-length is slated to drop on October 20. That news was enough to get fans thrilled and to immediately get her name trending, even if much is still unknown.\n\nWhile she revealed the album's release date, Minaj didn't share any additional information. Fans still don't know what it will be called or when the rapper will begin doling out singles from the album...or if she already has.\n\nIt's also unclear what songs of Minaj's will be featured on the set. As she has released dozens since her last album came out, she may bundle them all into a new compilation-style project or she may leave many of her recent wins as standalone cuts and write and record all new material.\n\nMinaj's last album, Queen, was released in August 2018. It peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and spun off several major hits, such as \"Good Form,\" \"Chun-Li,\" \"Barbie Dreams,\" and \"Barbie Dreams\" with Ariana Grande. Since then, Minaj has released one compilation, Queen Radio: Volume 1, which broke into the top 10 on the Billboard 200 in summer 2022.\n\nWhile she hasn't released a new album in five years, Minaj has been very busy musically.

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nF.B.I. officials briefed lawmakers on an unsubstantiated bribery allegation against Joe Biden when he was vice president, but did not let them leave a secure area with a document detailing it.\n\nHouse Republicans said on Monday that they would move this week to hold the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, in contempt of Congress, escalating their attacks on the federal law enforcement agency as they grasp for evidence of wrongdoing by President Biden. Representative James R. Comer, the Kentucky Republican who is chairman of the Oversight Committee, made the announcement after summoning F.B.I. officials to Capitol Hill for a closed-door briefing on a document containing an unverified allegation of bribery against Mr. Biden when he was vice president. The Trump Justice Department investigated the allegation, which involved his son Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings in Ukraine, in 2020, but prosecutors could not substantiate the claims, according to two people familiar with the matter. Yet Mr. Comer, who has said he is investigating whether Mr. Biden traded on his office for money, has repeatedly insinuated that there is more to it; on Monday, he asserted that the allegation \u201chas never been disproven.\u201d At the chairman\u2019s insistence, Mr. Wray\u2019s team brought the document to a secure area of the Capitol on Monday and briefed Mr. Comer and Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, on it for about 90 minutes. But Mr. Comer complained afterward that the agency, citing concern about protecting the identity of the informant, declined to allow other members of the committee to view it.\n\n\u201cWe will now initiate contempt of Congress hearings this Thursday,\u201d Mr. Comer told reporters on Capitol Hill, adding, \u201cThe ball is in the F.B.I.\u2019s court.\u201d The surfacing of the unsubstantiated allegation against Mr. Biden is the latest bid by Republicans to undermine the credibility of the F.B.I., which they have sought to vilify after the bureau and the Justice Department began investigations into President Donald J. Trump\u2019s role in trying to overturn the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents after leaving the White House. Republicans have relied on former F.B.I. agents \u2014 some of whom have embraced Jan. 6 conspiracy theories and have even accepted money from a Trump ally \u2014 to provide information against the bureau. Mr. Raskin said the document Mr. Comer sought, and Mr. Wray provided, contained an allegation from an informant relaying a conversation with someone else, which the informant could not corroborate. He said the Justice Department under former Attorney General William P. Barr \u201cfound no reason to escalate it from an assessment to a so-called preliminary investigation.\u201d\n\nCalling attention to the document is Mr. Comer\u2019s latest effort to keep public attention on Hunter Biden\u2019s business activities, which Republicans have made a focus of their investigations for years. \u201cWe are not interested in whether the allegations against Vice President Biden are accurate or not,\u201d Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said last week on Fox News. \u201cWe\u2019re responsible for making sure the F.B.I. does its job.\u201d Republicans have long alleged that Hunter Biden used his seat on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma \u2014 for which he was paid substantial sums \u2014 to influence his father. A career State Department official even raised concerns with a senior White House official in 2015 about the situation. The attention on Hunter Biden from the right reached a high point in 2020, after Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani began circulating materials about the younger Mr. Biden, including photos and documents from a laptop he had abandoned at a Delaware repair shop.\n\nOne person familiar with the material who insisted on anonymity to discuss it said some of it was junk that was plainly not credible. The bribery allegation against Mr. Biden was never elevated to a preliminary investigation, according to people familiar with the inquiry, but Mr. Brady did forward some information from his work to other prosecutors. Richard P. Donoghue, then a top official in the Trump Justice Department, agreed with Mr. Brady that the matter did not need to be investigated further, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Representative Dan Goldman, Democrat of New York and a member of the Oversight Committee who examined allegations against Mr. Biden and Burisma as part of a House impeachment team in 2019, said the Republican narrative had fallen flat because Mr. Biden sought to crack down on corruption in Ukraine, not enable it.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/us/politics/hunter-biden-ukraine.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/10/us/politics/hunter-biden-house-republicans-report.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/us/politics/hunter-biden-justice-department-pittsburgh.html", "https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/HSGAC%20-%20Finance%20Joint%20Report%202020.09.23.pdf"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": "1fb45388d7e240b0826090963e22cf3c", "name": "Luke Broadwater"}, {"id": "7022bad428b346018e21ea9254fdc36f", "name": "Adam Goldman"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Mr. Biden", "weight": 0.11070954}, {"name": "Mr. Comer", "weight": 0.09454035}, {"name": "Mr. Wray", "weight": 0.090588726}, {"name": "Mr. Brady", "weight": 0.08968592}, {"name": "Mr. Raskin", "weight": 0.08579103}, {"name": "President Biden", "weight": 0.08381897}, {"name": "Hunter Biden", "weight": 0.08146678}, {"name": "Vice President Biden", "weight": 0.07885217}, {"name": "Biden", "weight": 0.07813048}, {"name": "Joe Biden", "weight": 0.0768611}], "topics": [{"name": "GOP"}], "categories": [{"name": "Politics"}], "entities": [{"data": "Republicans", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 9}, {"data": "Democrat", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Ukrainian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "F.B.I.", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 7}, {"data": "House", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Congress", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "the Oversight Committee", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Capitol Hill", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Justice Department", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Fox News", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Burisma", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Joe Biden", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 11}, {"data": "Christopher A.

Here\u2019s what experts say that means for families.", "content": "Whether children were breastfed as infants and for how long may have an impact on their test scores when they are adolescents, according to new research.\n\nThe report, published Monday in the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood, followed about 5,000 British children from their infancy in the early 2000s to their last year of high school, according to lead study author Dr. Rene\u00e9 Pereyra-El\u00edas, a doctoral student and researcher in the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit at the University of Oxford.\n\nThe children were divided into groups based on how long they were breastfed: not at all, a few months, or for a year or more, according to the study. Researchers then compared the children\u2019s results in the UK\u2019s General Certificate of Secondary Education testing in their final years of secondary school.\n\nWhat the study team found was that there was a modest improvement in test scores associated with being breastfed longer, Pereyra-El\u00edas said.\n\nCompared with those who never had breast milk, children who were breastfed for at least 12 months were 39% more likely to have a high pass for both math and English GCSE exams and were 25% less likely to fail the English exam.\n\nBut that does not mean that every family must breastfeed their child, Pereyra-El\u00edas said.\n\nIt isn\u2019t possible for every family to breastfeed, and those who don\u2019t should not be shamed or feel guilty that they might be putting their children at a disadvantage, he said.\n\nThe analysis is careful and especially strong due to the size of its sample, said Dr. Kevin McConway, professor emeritus of applied statistics at the Open University in England.\n\nMcConway was not involved in the research.\n\n\u201cThough the results are certainly interesting, you have to bear in mind the limitations that inevitably arise in research using observational data from major cohort studies,\u201d McConway added.\n\nThe link between breastfeeding and test scores\n\nThe fact that the study was observational means it followed people\u2019s behavior rather than randomly assigning the behavior in question, McConway noted.\n\nConsequently, the results only show a correlation between breastfeeding and test scores \u2014 not causation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not possible to be certain about what\u2019s causing what,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, mothers who have a higher socioeconomic position are more likely to breastfeed their children, and their children are more likely to do well in school, McConway said.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s the breastfeeding that causes the children to do well at school \u2014 obviously it could be some other aspect of the fact that their family is relatively well off,\u201d he added.\n\nIt could be that something about breastfeeding causes children to be more likely to do well on their exams, but it could also be that another independent factor influences both the chances that the child will be breastfed and do well on their tests, McConway said.\n\nThe researchers tried to control for many factors that might influence their results, like the mother\u2019s cognitive ability, but they couldn\u2019t account for everything in an observational study, Pereyra-El\u00edas said.\n\n\u201cThere may be some confounding factors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did the best we could.\u201d\n\nThe study showed test results as one of many possible benefits of breastfeeding, said Dr. Andrew Whitelaw, professor emeritus of neonatal medicine at the University of Bristol in England. Whitelaw was not involved in the research.\n\nThe difference this study showed was modest, Pereyra-El\u00edas added, meaning that it does not make a big enough difference on the test scores that it should cause parents worry, Pereyra-El\u00edas said.\n\nThe takeaway is that families in general should be encouraged to breastfeed because of multiple possible benefits, but that it still may not be best for each individual family, he said.\n\nAnd more studies need to be done to confirm the findings \u2014 especially ones that account for the variables among families, Pereyra-El\u00edas said.\n\n\u201cEven though these questions have been around for almost a century, we still do not have a definitive answer,\u201d he said.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://adc.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/archdischild-2022-325148", "https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/07/health/baby-formula-marketing", "https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/03/health/cronobacter-infection-cdc-case-report"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": "3cd147e1b7a340d1a498022a930b646c", "name": "Madeline Holcombe"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Dr. Kevin McConway", "weight": 0.098707855}, {"name": "major cohort studies", "weight": 0.087368995}, {"name": "Kevin McConway", "weight": 0.08632867}, {"name": "Dr. Andrew Whitelaw", "weight": 0.08485971}, {"name": "test scores", "weight": 0.08195231}, {"name": "more studies", "weight": 0.07939078}, {"name": "professor emeritus", "weight": 0.079222046}, {"name": "study", "weight": 0.07868557}, {"name": "McConway", "weight": 0.07781444}, {"name": "England", "weight": 0.07695712}], "topics": [{"name": "Data"}], "categories": [{"name": "Health"}], "entities": [{"data": "Archives of Disease in Childhood", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "General Certificate of Secondary Education", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "British", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Rene\u00e9 Pereyra-El\u00edas", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 7}, {"data": "Kevin McConway", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "Andrew Whitelaw", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "UK", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "England", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "the United Kingdom", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "English", "type": "LANGUAGE", "mentions": 2}], "companies": [], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.07906474, "negative": 0.1571143, "neutral": 0.76382095}, "summary": "A new study has found that whether children were breastfed as infants or for long periods may have an impact on their test scores when they are adolescents.
