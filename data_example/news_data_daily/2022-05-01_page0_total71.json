One possibility is that they could remove ranking points from the Grand Slam tournament, which runs from 27 June to 10 July.\n\n\"The 2,000 points, whenever we go to the Grand Slams, they are really important and we have to go to those tournaments,\" added Nadal, who is a member of the ATP player council. \"So we will have to see the measures that we take.\n\n\"What happens in our game doesn't have any importance when we can see so many people dying and suffering and seeing the bad situation they are having in Ukraine.\"\n\nNadal is set to return to action at the Madrid Open this week, having been sidelined since 22 March with a rib injury.\n\n\"Talking about the injury, I'm recovered, I feel good,\" said Nadal, who won the Australian Open earlier this year.\n\n\"Talking about my tennis game and preparations, well, it's a completely different story.\n\n\"Anyone who has broken a rib knows how limiting it is, very painful, especially the first weeks.

The grain warehouse was destroyed. The warehouse with fertilizers was also shelled. They continued shelling of residential neighborhoods\u201d in Kharkiv and the Donbas region.\n\n\u201cThe ruined lives of people and the burned or stolen property will give nothing to Russia,\u201d he added. \u201cIt will only increase the toxicity of the Russian state and the number of those in the world who will work to isolate Russia.\u201d\n\nThere were an estimated 1,000 civilians holed up in Mariupol on Sunday. Mr. Zelenskyy said more evacuations could take place Monday, but only if conditions are right.\n\nThe first group of evacuees were taken to different locations, some in Ukrainian territory and others in territory now controlled by Russia and its Ukrainian allies, officials said.\n\nSEE ALSO: USAID administrator warns of the war in Ukraine expanding into a global crisis\n\nMrs. Pelosi has become the most senior U.S. lawmaker to meet face-to-face with Mr. Zelenskyy since the invasion began, leading a congressional delegation on an unannounced visit to Kyiv over the weekend.\n\nThe California Democrat said Sunday the lawmakers discussed the need for continued assistance and delivered a message of unity in their meeting with Mr. Zelenskyy.\n\n\u201cOur delegation traveled to Kyiv to send an unmistakable and resounding message to the entire world: America stands firmly with Ukraine,\u201d Mrs. Pelosi said in a statement Sunday.\n\nCongress is poised to take up President Biden\u2019s new request for an additional $33.4 billion in Ukraine aid from Congress, including $20 billion in security assistance, $8.5 billion in economic assistance, and $3 billion in humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe Biden administration has provided nearly $3.4 billion in assistance to Ukraine since the Russians invaded in late February.\n\nThe delegation included Democratic Reps. Gregory Meeks of New York, James McGovern and William Keating of Massachusetts, Adam Schiff and Barbara Lee of California, and Jason Crow of Colorado. Following their visit to Ukraine, the lawmakers continued to Poland where they met with President Andrzej Duda and senior officials.\n\n\u201cThis is a time we stand up for democracy or we allow autocracy to rule the day,\u201d Mr. Meeks, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told reporters in Poland on Sunday.\n\nMr. Crow, a member of the House Intelligence and Armed Services committees, stressed the importance of arming the Ukrainians and ensuring Russia is defeated.\n\n\u201cWe have to make sure the Ukrainians have what they need to win,\u201d Mr. Crow said. \u201cWhat we have seen in the last two months is their ferocity, their intense pride, their ability to fight, and their ability to win if they have the support to do so.\u201d\n\nDespite strong bipartisan support for Ukraine on Capitol Hill, the way forward for the latest Ukraine-aid request remains muddled.\n\nDemocratic leaders have yet to settle on whether the aid will be combined with other spending priorities such as more money for pandemic relief. The Senate will be in session this week, but the House does not return until May 10 for an eight-day legislative session.\n\nAs the bill inches through Congress, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee warned Sunday that \u201ctime is of the essence\u201d to help Ukraine hold off its larger and better-armed neighbor in the expected coming offensive in the south and east.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have a lot of time to waste in Congress,\u201d Rep. Michael T. McCaul, Texas Republican, told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cEvery day we don\u2019t send them more weapons is a day where more people will be killed and a day where they could lose this war. I think they can win it, but we have to give them the tools to do it.\u201d\n\nSenate Democrats have considered pairing the emergency funding with a stalled $10 billion coronavirus package, which Republicans have so far declined to support.\n\nRepublicans have blocked consideration of the coronavirus legislation in a fight over the White House\u2019s proposal to end Title 42, an emergency order using the pandemic health crisis to justify quickly expelling migrants from entering the U.S. from Mexico.\n\nMrs. Pelosi said last week that lawmakers would need to figure out how to quickly address both issues.\n\n\u201cWe have emergencies here. We need to have the COVID money and time is of the essence because we need the Ukraine money,\u201d the California Democrat said.\n\nIn an interview with CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday, Sen. Tim Kaine, Virginia Democrat, said a decision on whether to link the two funding issues remained up in the air.\n\n\u201cThe procedure of where you put bills together [or] separate them is quirky and sometimes unpredictable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need COVID aid. We need Ukraine aid.

Adam Kinzinger, Illinois Republican, said U.S. lawmakers should start thinking about a direct U.S.-Russia confrontation if the crisis spins out of control, even though Mr. Biden and leaders of NATO have adamantly ruled out Western troops taking part in the war.\n\nMr. Kinzinger compared the current situation in Ukraine to pre-World War II and said while the U.S. should continue to work to contain the ongoing war, it should also be prepared to respond in the event of a Russian escalation.\n\n\u201cIf Vladimir Putin wants to escalate with the West, he will,\u201d Mr. Kinzinger told CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s easy for him to do it. And I think right now what we\u2019re doing with supply and with lend-lease, with the financing, is right.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know \u2026 prior to World War II, there were moments nobody ever wanted to get involved and eventually came to realize they had to,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope we don\u2019t get to that point here, but we should be ready if we do.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov for the first time explicitly denied growing fears in the West that the Putin government was pressing for a major military breakthrough in Ukraine in time for the annual May 9 Victory Day celebrations in Moscow celebrating Russia\u2019s military and its role in the defeat of Nazi Germany.\n\n\u201cOur soldiers won\u2019t base their actions on a specific date,\u201d the veteran Russian diplomat told an Italian television interviewer Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll commemorate our victory in a solemn manner, but the timing and speed of what is happening in Ukraine will hinge on the need to minimize risks for civilians and Russian soldiers,\u201d he added, speaking in Russian through an Italian interpreter.\n\nIn another sign that the invasion has proven unexpectedly difficult for Mr. Putin and the Russian military, Ukrainian officials said over the weekend that one of Mr. Putin\u2019s most senior defense aides, military Chief of Staff Gen. Valery Gerasimov, made an unpublicized visit to the front lines of the fighting in eastern Ukraine to assess the situation and \u201cchange the course\u201d of the fighting, the New York Times reported.\n\nThere were even reports that the general or other senior Russian officials had been wounded by a Ukrainian missile strike during the dangerous visit, but they could not be confirmed.\n\n\u2014 Haris Alic contributed to this article, which was based in part on wire-service reports.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2022/may/1/usaid-administrator-warns-war-ukraine-expanding-gl/", "https://goo.gl/forms/xGjXcUKYsKxMeCUl1", "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2022/may/1/path-forward-33-billion-ukraine-package-muddled-hi/"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": null, "name": "Joseph Clark"}, {"id": "5afa22c7b0b74a9bbb799acbab35d962", "name": "David R.

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nOleg Tinkov spoke out against his country\u2019s war in Ukraine. Now he is in hiding. In an exclusive interview he said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in Russia\u2019s future\u2019\u2019 under Vladimir Putin.\n\nOleg Y. Tinkov was worth more than $9 billion in November, renowned as one of Russia\u2019s few self-made business tycoons after building his fortune outside the energy and minerals industries that were the playgrounds of Russian kleptocracy. Then, last month, Mr. Tinkov, the founder of one of Russia\u2019s biggest banks, criticized the war in Ukraine in a post on Instagram. The next day, he said, President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s administration contacted his executives and threatened to nationalize his bank if it did not cut ties with him. Last week, he sold his 35 percent stake to a Russian mining billionaire in what he describes as a \u201cdesperate sale, a fire sale\u201d that was forced on him by the Kremlin. \u201cI couldn\u2019t discuss the price,\u201d Mr. Tinkov said. \u201cIt was like a hostage \u2014 you take what you are offered. I couldn\u2019t negotiate.\u201d Mr. Tinkov, 54, spoke to The New York Times by phone on Sunday, from a location he would not disclose, in his first interview since Mr. Putin invaded Ukraine. He said he had hired bodyguards after friends with contacts in the Russian security services told him he should fear for his life, and quipped that while he had survived leukemia, perhaps \u201cthe Kremlin will kill me.\u201d\n\nIt was a swift and jarring turn of fortune for a longtime billionaire who for years had avoided running afoul of Mr. Putin while portraying himself as independent of the Kremlin. His downfall underscores the consequences facing those in the Russian elite who dare to cross their president, and helps explain why there has been little but silence from business leaders who, according to Mr. Tinkov, are worried about the impact of the war on their lifestyles and their wallets.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Tinkov claimed that many of his acquaintances in the business and government elite told him privately that they agreed with him, \u201cbut they are all afraid.\u201d In the interview, Mr. Tinkov spoke out more forcefully against the war than has any other major Russian business leader. \u201cI\u2019ve realized that Russia, as a country, no longer exists,\u201d Mr. Tinkov said, predicting that Mr. Putin would stay in power a long time. \u201cI believed that the Putin regime was bad. But of course, I had no idea that it would take on such catastrophic scale.\u201d\n\nThe Kremlin did not respond to a request for comment. Tinkoff, the bank Mr. Tinkov started in 2006, denied his characterization of events and said there had been \u201cno threats of any kind against the bank\u2019s leadership.\u201d The bank, which announced last Thursday that Mr. Tinkov had sold his entire stake in the company to a firm run by Vladimir Potanin, a mining magnate close to Mr. Putin, appeared to be distancing itself from its founder. \u201cOleg has not been in Moscow for many years, did not participate in the life of the company and was not involved in any matters,\u201d Tinkoff said in a statement. Mr. Tinkov has also run into trouble in the West. He agreed to pay $507 million last year to settle a tax fraud case in the United States. In March, Britain included him on a list of sanctions against the Russian business elite. \u201cThese oligarchs, businesses and hired thugs are complicit in the murder of innocent civilians and it is right that they pay the price,\u201d Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said at the time. Mr. Tinkov is nevertheless widely seen as a rare Russian business pioneer, modeling his maverick capitalism on Richard Branson and morphing from irreverent beer brewer to founder of one of the world\u2019s most sophisticated online banks. He says he has never set foot in the Kremlin, and he has occasionally criticized Mr. Putin.\n\u2022 Growth slows to a crawl as war and Covid grip the biggest economies.\n\u2022 U.S. talk of \u2018victory\u2019 against Russia has some allies nervous.\n\u2022 Russia\u2019s top officer visited the front line to change the offensive\u2019s course, U.S. and Ukraine officials say. But unlike Russian tycoons who years ago broke with Mr. Putin and now live in exile, such as the former oil magnate Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky or the tech entrepreneur Pavel Durov, Mr. Tinkov found a way to coexist with the Kremlin and make billions \u2014 at least until April 19. That is when Mr. Tinkov published an emotional antiwar post on Instagram, calling the invasion \u201ccrazy\u201d and deriding Russia\u2019s military: \u201cWhy would we have a good army,\u2019\u2019 he asked, if everything else in the country is dysfunctional \u201cand mired in nepotism, servility and subservience?\u201d\n\nMr. Tinkov was already outside Russia at that point, having departed in 2019 to receive treatment for leukemia. He later stepped down and ceded control of Tinkoff, but kept a 35 percent stake in the company, which was valued at more than $20 billion on the London stock exchange last year. A day after the April 19 post, Mr. Tinkov said Sunday, the Kremlin contacted the bank\u2019s senior executives and told them that any association with their founder was now a major problem. \u201cThey said: \u2018The statement of your shareholder is not welcomed, and we will nationalize your bank if he doesn\u2019t sell it and the owner doesn\u2019t change, and if you don\u2019t change the name,\u2019\u201d Mr. Tinkov said, citing sources at Tinkoff he declined to identify. Pelosi\u2019s visit. In a sign of the United States\u2019 deepening commitment to Ukraine, Speaker Nancy Pelosi became the most senior American official to visit Kyiv, meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky and vowing to back Ukraine \u201cuntil victory is won.\u201d Mariupol evacuation. The long-awaited rescue of civilians from a sprawling steel plant in Mariupol is underway, according to Ukrainian officials and the United Nations. Mr. Zelensky said that about 100 civilians were being evacuated and are heading to a \u201ccontrolled area.\u201d Russian oil embargo. European Union countries are likely to approve a phased embargo on Russian oil, sealing a long-postponed measure that has divided the bloc\u2019s members and highlighted their dependence on Russian energy sources. E.U. ambassadors expect to give their final approval by the end of the week, officials said. On April 22, Tinkoff announced it would change its name this year, a step it claims was long planned. Behind the scenes, he says, Mr. Tinkov was scrambling to sell his stake \u2014 one that had already been devalued by Western sanctions against Russia\u2019s financial system. Mr. Tinkov said he was thankful to Mr. Potanin, the mining magnate, for allowing him to salvage at least some money from his company; he said that he could not disclose a price, but that he had sold at 3 percent of what he believed to be his stake\u2019s true value.\n\n\u201cThey made me sell it because of my pronouncements,\u201d Mr. Tinkov said. \u201cI sold it for kopecks.\u201d He had been considering selling his stake anyway, Mr. Tinkov said, because \u201cas long as Putin is alive, I doubt anything will change.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe in Russia\u2019s future,\u201d he said. \u201cMost importantly, I am not prepared to associate my brand and my name with a country that attacks its neighbors without any reason at all.\u201d Mr. Tinkov is concerned that a foundation he started that is dedicated to improving blood cancer treatment in Russia could also become a casualty of his financial trouble. He denied that he was speaking out in the hopes of getting the U.K. sanctions against him lifted, though he said he hoped the British government would eventually \u201ccorrect this mistake.\u201d He said that his illness \u2014 he is now suffering from graft-versus-host disease, a stem-cell transplant complication, he said \u2014 might have made him more courageous about speaking out than other Russian business leaders and senior officials. Members of the elite, he claimed, are \u201cin shock\u201d about the war and have called him in great numbers to offer support. \u201cThey understand that they are tied to the West, that they are part of the global market, and so on,\u201d Mr. Tinkov said. \u201cThey\u2019re fast, fast being turned into Iran. But they don\u2019t like it. They want their kids to spend their summer holidays in Sardinia.\u201d Mr. Tinkov said that no one from the Kremlin had ever contacted him directly, but that in addition to the pressure on his company, he heard from friends with security service contacts that he could be in physical danger.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/04/29/world/ukraine-russia-war-news/europe-ratchets-up-preparation-for-russian-oil-embargo-next-week?smid=url-copy&action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-russia-ukraine&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/14/world/europe/european-union-oil-embargo-russia-ukraine.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-russia-ukraine&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/05/01/world/ukraine-russia-war-news#growth-slows-to-a-crawl-as-war-and-covid-grip-the-biggest-economies", "https://www.euromoney.com/article/28ncuyapscgma5fyuwjcw/awards/awards-for-excellence/cees-best-digital-bank-2021-tinkoff-bank", "https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/15/business/a-mix-of-beer-free-speech-and-home-grown-hip.html", "https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-announces-65-new-russian-sanctions-to-cut-off-vital-industries-fuelling-putins-war-machine", "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/05/01/world/ukraine-russia-war-news#ukraine-russia-war-pelosi", "https://www.instagram.com/p/CciExous6w9/", "https://rutube.ru/video/7ef921f1c0171779aee36df965e23bfc/", "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/05/01/world/ukraine-russia-war-news/pelosi-and-democratic-lawmakers-vow-the-us-will-stand-with-ukraine?smid=url-copy&action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-russia-ukraine&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/01/world/europe/mariupol-steel-plant-evacuation.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-russia-ukraine&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/founder-russian-bank-pleads-guilty-tax-fraud", "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/05/01/world/ukraine-russia-war-news#russian-general-dead-valery-gerasimov", "https://origin.purple.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/oleg-y-tinkov/"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": "4a7aeb0ec477418c9e7b8f980ef145ec", "name": "Anton Troianovski"}, {"id": "75e41a7424564182b044595c40401ebd", "name": "Ivan Nechepurenko"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Mr. Tinkov", "weight": 0.103212595}, {"name": "Mr. Putin", "weight": 0.09117786}, {"name": "Mr. Zelensky", "weight": 0.08106859}, {"name": "Mr. Potanin", "weight": 0.08087386}, {"name": "Tinkov", "weight": 0.07269131}, {"name": "Oleg Tinkov", "weight": 0.07101354}, {"name": "other Russian business leaders", "weight": 0.068610504}, {"name": "Oleg Y.

They were shot in March by Russian soldiers, she said.\n\nBRUSSELS \u2014 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi traveled to Ukraine\u2019s capital over the weekend, leading the second senior American delegation to meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky in as many weeks and declare support for his country\u2019s fight to beat back the Russian invasion. With each visit \u2014 the secretaries of state and defense traveled to Kyiv last weekend \u2014 the promise of American commitment to a Ukrainian victory appears to grow, even as how the United States defines victory has remained uncertain, including whether concessions by Ukraine to achieve a peace deal are acceptable. On Sunday, a day after her visit to Ukraine, Ms. Pelosi told a news conference in Poland: \u201cAmerica stands with Ukraine. We stand with Ukraine until victory is won. And we stand with NATO.\u201d Ms. Pelosi, the second in line to succeed President Biden, is the highest-ranking American official to visit Kyiv since the war began, and her words carry weight, seeming to underscore an expanded view of American and allied war aims.\n\nHer visit, with a congressional delegation, followed a joint visit to Kyiv by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III only last Sunday. Mr. Austin caused some controversy and debate afterward when he appeared to shift the goal of the war from defending Ukraine\u2019s independence and territorial sovereignty to weakening Russia. \u201cWe want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can\u2019t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Austin said, implying that the United States wanted to erode Russian military power for years to come \u2014 presumably so long as Vladimir V. Putin, president of Russia, remains in power.\n\nIn one positive development on Sunday, the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross helped organize what was described as an \u201congoing\u201d evacuation of civilians from the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol, where they have been taking shelter with a dwindling number of Ukrainian soldiers who have refused to surrender to the Russians. Between 80 and 100 civilians arrived in a convoy of buses at a temporary accommodation center 18 miles east of the city, in the village of Bezimenne. The evacuation appeared to be the fruit of a visit to both Mr. Putin in Moscow and Mr. Zelensky in Kyiv last week by Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the U.N. secretary general, who called the war in Ukraine \u201can absurdity.\u201d Mr. Guterres and the Red Cross have been working to get humanitarian aid and supplies of food and water to civilians trapped by the fighting; any serious peace negotiations still appear far off.\n\nIn a Twitter message, Mr. Zelensky applauded the evacuation of what he said was a \u201cfirst group of about 100 people,\u201d and said that \u201ctomorrow we\u2019ll meet them in Zaporizhzhia.\u201d The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said in a statement that it would not provide details of the effort while it was continuing; further evacuations are expected to resume on Monday. Russian forces have not yet been able to finally take the last slice of Mariupol, which no longer matters militarily but which has been an inspiring symbol of Ukrainian bravery, morale and resistance that is bound to go down in Ukrainian history. But if there is a new allied consensus about supplying Ukraine with heavier and more sophisticated weapons for the latest stage of the war in eastern Ukraine, there is no allied consensus about switching the war aim from Ukraine to Russia.\n\nHe and others said that such talk from Washington plays perfectly into Mr. Putin\u2019s narrative that NATO is waging war against Russia, and that Russia is fighting a defensive war for its survival in Ukraine. That may give Mr. Putin the excuse on May 9, the annual celebration of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany, to declare this \u201cspecial military operation\u201d a war, which would allow him, if he chooses, to mobilize the population and use conscripts widely in the battle. Talk of victory over Russia \u201cgives easy ammunition to the other side and creates the fear that the West may go further, and it\u2019s not what we want,\u201d said Ulrich Speck, a German analyst. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to cut Russia into pieces.\u201d G\u00e9rard Araud, a former French ambassador to the United States and the United Nations, commented on Twitter: \u201cThe support to Ukraine in its modalities and its objectives should be agreed at a political level between allies. Right now, we are sleepwalking to nobody knows where.\u201d In response, Moscow has raised the tone of its own rhetoric. On Wednesday, Mr. Putin said that any countries who \u201ccreate a strategic threat to Russia\u201d during this war in Ukraine can expect \u201cretaliatory strikes\u201d that would be \u201clightning-fast.\u201d Days before, the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said in an interview that \u201cNATO is essentially going to war with Russia through a proxy and arming that proxy.\u201d Mr. Putin\u2019s military, having lost what Britain estimates to have been at least 15,000 killed in action \u2014 that is more than in the Soviet Union\u2019s entire war in Afghanistan \u2014 has been struggling to cut supply lines of Western arms, munitions and heavy weapons to Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine.\n\nBut that grinding effort is going slowly, with fierce artillery battles and high casualties on both sides. It is not just Ukraine\u2019s military that is being starved of supplies. There is now a shortage of gasoline and diesel, at least for civilian use, stemming from Russia\u2019s blockade of Ukrainian ports and attacks on refineries and fuel depots. Long lines for gasoline have been seen even in cities like Lviv, and there are concerns about the impact of the shortages on agriculture, even in fields untouched by the war. Pelosi\u2019s visit. In a sign of the United States\u2019 deepening commitment to Ukraine, Speaker Nancy Pelosi became the most senior American official to visit Kyiv, meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky and vowing to back Ukraine \u201cuntil victory is won.\u201d Mariupol evacuation. The long-awaited rescue of civilians from a sprawling steel plant in Mariupol is underway, according to Ukrainian officials and the United Nations. Mr. Zelensky said that about 100 civilians were being evacuated and are heading to a \u201ccontrolled area.\u201d Russian oil embargo. European Union countries are likely to approve a phased embargo on Russian oil, sealing a long-postponed measure that has divided the bloc\u2019s members and highlighted their dependence on Russian energy sources. E.U. ambassadors expect to give their final approval by the end of the week, officials said. A report by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said that only a fifth of almost 1,300 large agribusinesses surveyed by the government in mid-March had enough fuel to operate the farm equipment needed to plant corn, barley and other crops this spring, which is already causing rising food prices in countries far from Ukraine. In a possible indication of flagging Russian morale, the chief of staff of the Russian armed forces, Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, the country\u2019s top uniformed officer, made a visit to a dangerous frontline position in eastern Ukraine this weekend in an effort to \u201cchange the course\u201d of Russia\u2019s offensive there, according to a senior Ukrainian official with knowledge of the visit. Ukrainian forces launched an attack on a Russian headquarters in Izium on Saturday evening, but General Gerasimov had already left to return to Russia, the official said. Still, some 200 soldiers, including at least one general, were killed, the Ukrainian official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive military operation. A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that General Gerasimov had been in eastern Ukraine but did not confirm the rest of the Ukrainian account. Fighting has intensified around the large eastern city of Kharkiv in recent days as Ukrainian forces have attempted to push away Russian units. Though the gains have been small, they are emblematic of both the Ukrainian and Russian forces\u2019 strategy as the war drags into its third month, one that focuses on a village at a time and leverages concentrated artillery fire to dislodge one another.\n\nRepresentative Jason Crow, a Democrat from Colorado, a veteran and a member of the House intelligence and armed services committee, said his focus was on the supply of weapons. \u201cWe have to make sure the Ukrainians have what they need to win,\u201d he said. Praising Ukrainian bravery, he said, \u201cThe United States of America is in this to win, and we will stand with Ukraine until victory is won.\u201d But as ever, what is meant by \u201cvictory,\u201d whether it involves pushing Russia entirely out of Ukraine or just blocking its advance until its offensive runs out of steam and negotiations ensue, remains an open question. So does the equally central question of what Mr. Putin decides is victory enough for his own war of choice.

But there\u2019s something about it that I can\u2019t quit\u2019  The Guardian", "content": "Mid-morning in New Orleans, and outside an Uptown coffee shop, Win Butler is talking of life in his adopted city \u2013 the basketball, brass bands, and the poisonous caterpillars of the buck moth that, in late spring, fall from the city\u2019s trees on to unsuspecting passersby beneath. He surveys the mighty oaks across the street, broad-branched and strung with moss. \u201cTrees run this city,\u201d Butler says. \u201cThey\u2019ve definitely seen some shit, those trees.\u201d\n\nWith his wife, R\u00e9gine Chassagne, Butler is best known for fronting Arcade Fire. The band formed in Montreal at the turn of the millennium, quickly gained a reputation as one of the world\u2019s finest live acts, and over the course of five albums became indie music aristocracy. They were anointed by Davids Bowie and Byrne; they won a Grammy, a Juno and a Brit; they played Obama\u2019s inauguration; and frequently used their platform for political activism, promoting healthcare nonprofits, indigenous protesters and a number of Haitian charities (Chassagne is of Haitian descent). More recently, the band raised $100,000 for the Ukraine Relief Fund by playing a series of small club shows across the US, including cult New York venue the Bowery ballroom.\n\nAt times they have irked their audiences: the hijinks that surrounded the launch of their disco-tinged 2013 album Reflektor \u2013 secret gigs, street parties, audience dress codes \u2013 brought faintly unsettling echoes of U2\u2019s Zoo TV campaign. But it was the release of their last album, 2017\u2019s Everything Now, that rattled fans the most. The album was accompanied by a high-concept promotional campaign claiming that Arcade Fire were now part of a multinational corporation. They named their tour Infinite Content, and posted parodic record reviews, fake news stories, ironic product placements. To some, it was a glittering commentary on the consumer age; to others it seemed sneering, over-earnest and ill-conceived. To many, it was uncomfortably removed from the visceral heart-swell of their live shows.\n\nThis month, the band release their sixth album, We, a record they describe as being about \u201cthe forces that pull us away from the people we love \u2026 [and] the urgent need to overcome them\u201d. This being Arcade Fire, there is a hefty intellectual backstory, nods to the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* and a guest turn by Peter Gabriel. But it also stands as the band\u2019s most tender record since their early output; spacious and simple and sweet, an album born out of the steady closeness of pandemic days.\n\nButler, Chassagne and their son moved to Louisiana six years ago, captivated by its mingling of cultures and unbridled passion for music and creativity. \u201cWhat\u2019s that Mark Twain line about there being only three cities in America?\u201d Butler asks as we walk along Magazine Street. \u201cNew York, San Francisco and New Orleans. Everything else is Cleveland.\u201d\n\nButler cuts a conspicuous figure: basketball player-tall, with bleached blond hair, today he is wearing cream-coloured jeans, a tie-dyed white T-shirt and black bomber jacket. There is an intensity to the way he speaks, whether he is talking about a Mardi Gras spent playing cowbell in New Orleans\u2019 TBC Brass Band, or the hanging chads of the 2000 US presidential race. But he seems to fit comfortably in this neighbourhood, greeting the coffee shop barista warmly and gleefully relating the history of Miss Mae\u2019s, a 24-hour \u201cdirtbag bar\u201d that stands on the corner of Magazine and Napoleon.\n\nDown the street, Butler leads us into a former luncheonette, now home to Peaches Records. Peaches, he says, is some way removed from the record shop he frequented as a teenager in the suburbs of Houston, Texas \u2013 a chainstore in the mall that mostly sold CDs, and where he tried to nourish his love of New Order and the Cure. He talks of how his mother played jazz harp, his grandfather played the pedal steel, and how the first time he heard Smokey Robinson sing, he couldn\u2019t quite believe that this music had been made by human beings.\n\n\u201cLook at this,\u201d Butler says, holding up an octagonal copy of the Rolling Stones\u2019 compilation Through the Past Darkly, and holding forth on the qualities of a good record sleeve. His attention alights on Pink Floyd\u2019s Dark Side of the Moon, and the merits of the short album. \u201cThere\u2019s like four songs on it and a lot of connective tissue,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they sort of stretch it, so you have this space to hear stuff. That\u2019s not even my favourite record, but it\u2019s an example of coherence. You look at the album artwork, you listen to it, it\u2019s very coherent.\u201d He was seeking something similar on We, he says, paring back more songs than ever before to make a taut 40-minute record. \u201cWe cut some really good shit,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s how we did it.\u201d\n\nWe walk along Napoleon to a Creole-Italian restaurant to meet Chassagne. This afternoon, the rest of the band will arrive in New Orleans to begin tour rehearsals, and Butler is eager to be back out in the world again after the restrictions of lockdown. He recalls the band\u2019s recent show in New York, how good it felt to be before a crowd once more. \u201cOne hundred people spitting in my face,\u201d he says. \u201cIt felt like being baptised.\u201d\n\nAt the counter in Pascal\u2019s Manale, the oyster shucker Thomas \u201cUptown T\u201d Stewart stands beside a mound of silver shells, discussing the peaceful pleasures of Cyrano de Bergerac, jazz, poetry and softly spoken people. We are drinking martinis, and Butler is trying to persuade me that the best way to eat an oyster is to sit it atop a saltine cracker, with horseradish, ketchup and a little lemon juice. Chassagne stands beside him and unceremoniously slugs black a Gulf oyster from its shell. Stewart is impressed. \u201cYou knocked that down like you just did a shot of good bourbon!\u201d he tells her. \u201cI caught your rhythm. You have a lot of good energy.\u201d\n\nChassagne\u2019s energy has always been undeniable. When Butler first saw her she was singing jazz standards at an art opening in Montreal, and he immediately asked her to join his fledgling band. The strands of what she has described as her \u201cgrandmother music\u201d \u2013 opera and Jacques Brel and Edith Piaf, somehow melding with Butler\u2019s art pop influences. On stage, they perform a similar feat: Chassagne singing, dancing, shifting between accordion, keys and xylophone, seemingly existing in her own orbit as the rest of the band play on.\n\nBack at the table this lunchtime, she sits in a black batwing top and black jeans, her dark curls jigging along to the theme to Captain Kangaroo, inexplicably playing on the restaurant stereo. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard this song in for ever!\u201d she says, suddenly distracted. Chassagne does this often \u2013 a sentence drawing suddenly to a halt so she can sing along with a chorus, then dart back to the conversation.\n\nBefore the detour into Captain Kangaroo, she was recalling how the new album took root in pre-Covid America, in the days of the Trump presidency. \u201cIt was pretty turbulent times in the US,\u201d she says. \u201cYou would wake up and you had no idea what was going to happen.\u201d The band began work on a record they hoped might reflect that turbulence: tracks such as the slow, syrupy End of the Empire reflecting the decline of western power, with references to the cauterising effect of television, the urge to unsubscribe and watching the moon on the ocean \u201cwhere California used to be\u201d.\n\nThe album opens with Age of Anxiety I and II, tracks that take their name from Lawrence Ferlinghetti\u2019s 1958 poem I Am Waiting. When Butler was 15, his beatnik English teacher invited his good friend Ferlinghetti to read at his school. It was a life-changing moment for Butler; so much so that he stole a copy of the poet\u2019s Coney Island of the Mind from the school library. Not so long ago, he found the book in a box of his belongings at his parents\u2019 house and began rereading. When he came across the poem I Am Waiting, \u201cI just started weeping,\u201d he says. \u201cAll the themes in that poem, it\u2019s like all the shit I write about. Like looking for the soul of America, waiting for the American eight ball to straighten up and fly right. It got so deep in me. Like a spirit got in me.\u201d\n\nButler\u2019s relationship with his homeland has always been complicated and contradictory and highly charged. \u201cThis shit is fucking rotten, but there\u2019s beautiful things about it,\u201d he says. \u201cI live in America, I can\u2019t believe I still live in America. But there\u2019s something about it that I can\u2019t quit. And as an artist you\u2019re trying to break something open and let the light in.\u201d\n\nHe talks about the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan and the war in Ukraine. \u201cAnd it\u2019s poor people who suffer,\u201d he says. \u201cAlways, everywhere, always poor people suffer. Russian oligarchs are losing one of their boats, like boo hoo. Which boat did you lose? They\u2019re all fine. But all the money is blood money, it\u2019s all from the suffering of poor people.\u201d\n\nWhat role can music play? Butler pauses. \u201cWe\u2019re the court jesters,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re performing in the court. The infrastructure of the thing is money. I don\u2019t know the answer. But you can kind of undercut it.\u201d\n\nAcross the table, Chassagne frowns. \u201cIt\u2019s not the court,\u201d she says firmly. \u201cThere\u2019s no prerequisite on who to play music for. We play music in hospitals, for dying patients, we played at the inauguration. It\u2019s food for the soul. It\u2019s not that the music cures the community, but the music is the evidence that there is a community. It\u2019s like evidence of life.\u201d\n\nArcade Fire\u2019s lineup has shifted over the years, but for We it numbered Richard Reed Parry, Tim Kingsbury, Jeremy Gara and Butler\u2019s younger brother Will, who has since amicably left the band. When the pandemic began, they had all flown to New Orleans to begin work on the new record. \u201cAnd then our phones keep beeping and we\u2019re getting texts saying flights are getting cancelled, borders getting closed,\u201d remembers Chassagne. \u201cSo we had to do an emergency plan for them to go back immediately. Everything was falling apart.\u201d\n\nWhen everyone departed, Chassagne and Butler were left with three days\u2019 worth of demos. \u201cGlorified writing sessions\u201d, as Butler puts it. \u201cBut at a point, I thought: \u2018Well, this might be all there is so I\u2019m going to work on this as if we\u2019re never going to play music again,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I realised that even just three days, there was so much music in there. So it was like: well, that\u2019s all we have. This is it. It\u2019s DIY.\u201d\n\nFor months, the pair stayed home and wrote with an intensity that they had been unable to find since their debut album, Funeral. \u201cWe were stuck in our house and so what do you do?\u201d says Chassagne. \u201cI guess the interesting thing is that when you\u2019re stuck with yourself you ask: \u2018What am I here for?!\u2019 So we just wrote and wrote and recorded \u2026 \u201d The songs soon began to pile up. \u201cWe just worked every day,\u201d says Butler. \u201cAll night, as if it was due the next day, but for like, a year.\u201d\n\nOn Butler and Chassagne\u2019s first date they went to see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Chassagne had failed to mention that the film would have French subtitles, and so she spent the movie whispering translations to Butler in the dark of the cinema. Today over lunch, there seems a similar connection; a closeness to their dynamic that I have not seen since I interviewed them back in 2005 for Funeral. Their sentences frequently overlap, Butler picking up where Chassagne leaves off.\n\nTheir new album might come with a clever marketing campaign, slick videos, an artful mission statement that mentions Carl Jung and Martin Luther King. But at its heart lies something really quite simple: the connection that spans between the extended family of a band, that exists between a band and its audience, that binds two people over the course of a 20-year relationship.\n\nThere are two distinct halves to this record: the first tells of isolation, the second is about resolve. \u201cIt\u2019s about unconditional love, love that\u2019s not merit-based,\u201d says Butler. \u201cThat\u2019s not about loving someone because they\u2019re such a good person, or they\u2019re so talented. It\u2019s love that has nothing to do with what you did, it\u2019s something that\u2019s freely given, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s the most precious thing.\u201d He begins to sip Chassagne\u2019s untouched martini. \u201cLoving someone is hard,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s up and down, it\u2019s a tough thing, but it\u2019s also the shit.\u201d Chassagne nods. \u201cAnd the beauty\u2019s in the commitment.\u201d\n\nOutside, the city is closing down under a tornado warning, shops shuttering, restaurants hurrying away their patio chairs. We drive back along Magazine Street with the windows down and the high winds blowing, listening to a top-secret remix of Age of Anxiety II (Rabbit Hole), a call-and-response track between the pair. \u201cNothing can ever replace it / When it\u2019s gone you can still taste it,\u201d runs the lyric. \u201cGoing on this trip together \u2026 \u201d\n\nIn the front seat, Butler shakes his head; behind him Chassagne pats her hands rhythmically into the air, silently finding her way into the song. We drive on through the Garden District, past a seafood boil and the alligator museum, and on towards Arcade Fire\u2019s rehearsal space. Outside, against the darkening sky, the tops of the oak trees wave wildly.\n\nWe is released on 6 May.\n\u2022 None If you\u2019d like to hear this piece narrated, listen to the Guardian\u2019s new podcast, Weekend.

Sunday, and residents were urged to flee to Zaporozhye, 140 miles to the west, authorities said. Scores of civilians, including some women and children, were evacuated over the weekend from in and around the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, the Russian state-run Tass media outlet reported Sunday. Up to 2,000 Ukrainian fighters and an estimated 1,000 civilians remain in and around the plant, the last major holdout in the city. It's unclear how many civilians remain in Mariupol, trapped with little food, water or utilities. International estimates have put the number at 100,000; Mayor Vadym Boychenko said Sunday the number is much higher.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi met with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a visit to the country\u2019s embattled capital, Kyiv. Pelosi, second in line to succeed the president, is the highest-ranking American leader to visit Ukraine since the start of the war, and her visit marks a major show of continuing support for the country's struggle against Russia.\n\nThe annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner returned Saturday after a two-year COVID hiatus, with President Joe Biden in attendance as the first president in six years to accept an invitation. Biden took the opportunity to make light of the criticism he has faced in his 18 months in office, aiming jokes at Donald Trump, the Republican Party and members of the press. Trevor Noah, host of \"The Daily Show,\" hosted the event and spoke after Biden. Celebrities, including Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson, were also in attendance, while Vice President Kamala Harris stayed home after testing positive for COVID-19 earlier this week.\n\u2022 With help from Kim Kardashian, Joe Biden made the White House Correspondents' Dinner great again\n\nThe party that was the 2022 NFL draft is in the books and it included a bold move at the first overall pick, a surprising trade and some intriguing first-round selections. Interest in this year's crop of quarterbacks was tepid at best. Once the three-day event wrapped up on Saturday, some longsuffering teams like the New York Jets got top marks in USA TODAY Sports' ridiculously premature draft grades. The Baltimore Ravens also found themselves among the draft winners, while New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick ranked among the losers. And even though this year's draft just ended, it's not too early to take a look at who might be the front-runners to be the No. 1 pick in the 2023 draft.\n\u2022 Protests erupt across Europe as tens of thousands rally to honor workers on May Day.\n\u2022 Amber Heard has yet to take the stand.

Judds' daughters Wynonna and Ashley announced her death on Saturday. \u201cToday we sisters experienced a tragedy. We lost our beautiful mother to the disease of mental illness,\u201d both sisters tweeted. Judd was the mother portion of the mother-daughter music duo The Judds, Wynonna being the other half. The two scored 14 No. 1 songs in a career that spanned nearly three decades, rising to the top of country music before calling it quits in 1991 after Naomi was diagnosed with hepatitis. Many stars took to Twitter to share their memories of the music legend, who is being inducted into the Country Hall of Fame on Sunday. \"Country music lost a true legend \u2026 sing with the angels, Naomi,\" Carrie Underwood said.\n\u2022 'It brings tears to my heart': Carrie Underwood, Maren Morris, Tanya Tucker remember Naomi Judd\n\nThree Oklahoma meteorology students killed in car crash after Kansas storm\n\nA tornado that barreled through parts of Kansas destroyed or damaged hundreds of homes and buildings, injured several people and left more than 15,000 people without power, officials said Saturday. In addition to wreckage from the tornado itself, three University of Oklahoma meteorology students were killed in a crash Friday evening as they were traveling back from storm chasing in Kansas, according to officials. Nicholas Nair, 20, of Denton, Texas; Gavin Short, 19, of Grayslake, Illinois; and Drake Brooks, 22, of Evansville, Indiana, died in the crash, according to an Oklahoma Highway Patrol report.

Oil Dependence", "description": "Germany Speeds Up Time Frame For Ending Russian Oil Dependence  Forbes", "content": "Germany could end its reliance on Russian oil by the close of summer, the country\u2019s Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology reportedly announced Sunday, stepping up its previous timeline by at least three months\u2014barely three weeks after the European Union announced a ban on Russian coal imports.\n\nThe ministry said a German oil embargo taking effect near the end of summer following \u201ca sufficient transition period\u201d would be manageable, according to a government report released Sunday and translated by Bloomberg. The announcement came 11 days after German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the country planned to halt all Russian oil imports before the end of the year and eventually stop importing any energy from Russia\u2014though Germany may not succeed in ending its reliance on Russian natural gas until 2024, Reuters reported. The European Union plans to present a ban on Russian oil in a new series of proposed sanctions against Russia sometime this week, a measure supported by Germany, Deutsche Welle reported Sunday, citing unnamed sources. Ukrainian Minister for Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba tweeted Sunday that Ukraine would press for an oil embargo in the EU\u2019s next raft of sanctions against Russia, after the 27-nation bloc agreed to ban Russian coal last month. Germany was previously hesitant to support strong sanctions on Russian energy, as Russia provided roughly 55% of Germany\u2019s natural gas imports, 35% of its oil imports and 50% of its hard coal imports for 2021. However, Germany has since succeeded in cutting Russian fuel down to 25% of its oil imports, 40% of its natural gas imports and 25% of its hard coal imports, Reuters reported in April.\n\nAnxiety over Europe\u2019s reliance on Russian fuel predates Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Shortly prior to the invasion, the White House announced that it was sounding out backup sources of fuel for Europe and asking natural gas producers to temporarily surge output. Days before the invasion began in February, Germany scrapped the still-unopened $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which had the capacity to deliver as much as 55 billion cubic meters of Russian natural gas per year, cutting Russia off from tens of billions of dollars in potential revenue. In March, Germany struck a deal with Qatar to provide supplemental natural gas.

The next two to three weeks are going to be very pivotal and very decisive in this war. And I don\u2019t think we have a lot of time to waste. I wish we had [Biden\u2019s request] a little bit sooner, but we have it now.\u201d\n\nMcCaul added that he believed Republicans, who have supported the Democratic president\u2019s previous financial requests for Ukraine, might have acted more expediently if they held the House majority.\n\nThe chamber is not sitting during the coming week while members tend to in-district affairs, delaying debate and a vote on the aid package.\n\n\u201cIf I were speaker for a day, I\u2019d call Congress back into session, back into work,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEvery day we don\u2019t send them more weapons is a day where more people will be killed and a day where they could lose this war. I think they can win it. But we have to give them the tools to do it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Bob Menendez, the Democratic New Jersey senator who chairs the upper chamber\u2019s foreign relations committee, echoed Pelosi\u2019s pledge that the US would continue to support Ukraine financially.\n\n\u201cWe will do what it takes to see Ukraine win because it\u2019s not just about Ukraine, it\u2019s about the international order,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press.\n\n\u201cIf Ukraine does not win, if [Russia\u2019s president Vladimir] Putin can ultimately not only succeed in the Donbas but then be emboldened to go further, if he strikes a country under our treaty obligations with Nato, then we would be directly engaged.\n\n\u201cSo stopping Russia from getting to that point is of critical interest to us, as well as the world, so we don\u2019t have to send our sons and daughters into battle.

It entails $3bn of humanitarian assistance to meet those global needs, which are famine-level, acute malnutrition needs.\n\n\u201cAnd it includes very significant direct budget support for the government of Ukraine, because we want to ensure the government can continue providing services for its people.\u201d\n\n\u201cPutin would like nothing more than the government of Ukraine to go bankrupt and not be able to cater to the needs of the people.

But for Pasha, a 24-year old journalist from the breakaway region\u2019s capital, Tiraspol, this week\u2019s blasts were a clear sign that it was time to get out.\n\n\u201cThere was a chance that there would be more attacks, and it\u2019s no fun waiting to find out where would be hit next,\u201d he said. Adding to the uncertainty were growing rumours that men in the region would be mobilised to fight alongside Russian troops across the border in Ukraine.\n\nSo Pasha, his mother and his friend, fellow journalist Maxim, 23, packed their essentials and drove to the Moldovan capital, Chi\u0219in\u0103u, where they are staying with relatives. They are hoping to return home, but other friends who left Transnistria have already fled to Turkey, Poland or the Czech Republic.\n\nWith a population of 470,000 people, Transnistria is a predominantly Russian-speaking sliver of land wedged between the Nistru River and the Ukraine border.\n\nA year after Moldova declared independence from the Soviet Union, the region broke away in 1992 after a five-month war in which Russian forces (and Crimean Cossacks) intervened on the side of the separatists.\n\nNo country, not even Russia, has recognised the self-declared Transnistrian Moldovan Republic, but the \u201cfrozen conflict\u201d has kept Moldova partitioned ever since. Now, many fear that last week\u2019s explosions may herald a dangerous thaw.\n\nOn Monday, government buildings in Tiraspol were hit by what appeared to be rocket-propelled grenades. In the following days, blasts hit a radio tower broadcasting in Russian, and shots were reportedly fired near a Russian arms depot.\n\nSeparatist authorities in Tiraspol blamed the incidents on Ukrainian infiltrators. Kyiv has accused Russia of launching the attacks to further destabilise the region, while Moscow denounced them as \u201cacts of terror\u201d. Meanwhile, Moldova\u2019s pro-EU president, Maia Sandu, blamed the blasts on infighting between rival factions in Transnistria.\n\nBut the uncertainty has prompted growing concern that Moldova could be dragged into the Ukraine conflict.\n\nMoscow has long used Transnistria as a bargaining chip in its efforts to influence Moldova. The region still hosts 1,500 Russian troops, as well as 20,000 tonnes of ammunition stored in Cobasna, the largest ammunition depot in eastern Europe. Among last week\u2019s incidents were shootings a mile away from Cobasna, according to the Transnistrian authorities.\n\nMoldovan government sources fear that if the depot blew up it could result in an explosion 10 times bigger than the 2020 Beirut blast, where 2,000 tonnes of ammunition were stored.\n\nDespite its frail economy, Moldova has already received about 95,000 people fleeing the war in Ukraine, a figure equivalent to 3.5% of its population, according to the Moldovan foreign ministry.\n\nThe events of the past week are prompting many refugees to consider fleeing once again. \u201cIf war comes to Transnistria, I will leave, probably for Germany,\u201d said Lyuda, 35, an accountant and single mother who fled Mariupol in March and is now working for the UNHCR mission in Moldova.\n\nSecurity has been stepped up on the Transnistrian side of the border, causing long queues of traffic, but at the Moldovan checkpoints down the road, security forces simply wave vehicles through.\n\nMoldova\u2019s government has pledged to step up security, but for now life goes on as usual in Chi\u0219in\u0103u. In Valea Morilor park, joggers make laps around the lake, anglers cast their lines and the loudest sound is the voice of a canoe coach training her students.\n\nAcross the city, Chi\u0219in\u0103u\u2019s central market is packed with people buying food and offerings for the upcoming Pa\u0219tele Blajinilor, Moldova\u2019s holiday commemorating the dead. But even here, there is an edge of uncertainty. Alex, a stallholder in the market had just come off a call with a cousin in Italy who he was thinking of joining, he said. \u201cI have a wife and a baby, and I don\u2019t feel safe here,\u201d he said.\n\nInside Transnistria, separatist authorities have kept quiet about the war raging in Ukraine. \u201cTransnistria\u2019s leaders are being cautious,\u201d said the Moldovan journalist Alina Radu. \u201cThey are not cheering on the war, but nor are they criticising Russia\u2019s military aggression.\u201d\n\nSince the death of its Soviet-era industry, Transnistria\u2019s economy has been dominated by a small elite. Russia provides Transnistria with free gas, which gives businesses in the region a competitive advantage over Moldovan businesses.\n\nIts largest conglomerate, which controls everything from petrol stations to a cognac distillery \u2013 and the football club FC Sheriff \u2013 was co-founded by the former KGB agent Victor Gu\u0219an, who also has a Ukrainian passport and owns property in Kyiv.\n\n\u201cTransnistrian leaders are under a lot of pressure,\u201d said the Moldovan journalist Alina Radu. \u201cFor the first time, they are isolated. Both Moldova and Ukraine have governments that are not pro-Russian. Transnistrian elites have two options: to follow the orders of Putin, the most terrible dictator today, or to have a prosperous future with Europe.\u201d\n\nAnalysts in Chi\u0219in\u0103u warn that Russian security and propaganda networks are spreading.\n\nA recent report from the Royal United Services Institute, said Russian spy agency the FSB aimed \u201cto destabilise Moldova to tie down Ukrainian forces on the southern border, to counter growing pro-European sentiment in the country, and to show the west that support for Ukraine risks wider consequences, including in the Balkans\u201d.\n\nValeriu Pa\u0219a, from the Moldovan thinktank Watchdog said that Moscow had overestimated vestigial pro-Moscow sentiment in the country.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s aim is to create tension,\u201d he said, pointing to debunked viral reports that Romanian troops had been deployed near the border with Moldova.\n\nBut Moldova, with a population of just 2.5 million, has already suffered from mass emigration, and such pressures still had the potential to cause more harm, said Radu. \u201cI am afraid that the tension might generate yet another harmful wave of emigration \u2013 just as the government has been trying to bring back the diaspora.\u201d", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://static.rusi.org/special-report-202204-operation-z-web.pdf",

Before World War II, Poland had a robust Jewish community of about 3.5 million. The Nazis killed almost 90% of them, and many of those who survived and stayed in Poland stopped identifying as Jewish.\n\n\"They simply didn't tell. It was too painful. The survivors were too traumatized. They made a decision that it's no longer safe to be Jewish,\" said Schudrich.\n\nBut Poland's tiny Jewish population diminished even further in 1968 , when the communist government forced thousands to leave the country in an anti-Semitic purge. This dark chapter in Polish history stands in contrast to the generosity and compassion the country is showing Ukrainian refugees -- some of it a lesson learned, perhaps, from its own past.\n\n\"In March of 1968, there were rumblings in society against the government,\" Schudrich said.\n\nMany in Poland rejected the communist party's tightening grip over the country.\n\n\"The government decided that the best way to deal with this social tension -- the social opposition to the government -- was by claiming ... it's all the Jews doing it,\" Schudrich said.\n\nScapegoating the Jews was a tried-and-true tactic used by leaders for millennia, and it worked just as the communists, engaged in an internal power struggle, had hoped it would. For this story, Dana Bash's team spoke with members of her extended family in Warsaw and New York.\n\nIn the late 1960s, protests raged not just on American college campuses but at Polish universities as well. While American students marched in protest of the Vietnam War, students in Warsaw demonstrated against censorship in their country. And the communist government did not like it.\n\nThe incendiary speech plays on a loop on a bank of televisions in an exhibit at the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw. Joanna Fikus, who leads the exhibitions department at the museum, explained its significance to CNN.\n\n\"After this speech, this huge wave of anti-Semitic campaign began,\" she said, gesturing at the largest screen overhead.\n\nGomu\u0142ka spoke about the threats to Poland, referencing \"traitors.\"\n\n\"He never mentioned the word 'Jew,'\" Fikus explained. \"He didn't have to.\"\n\n\"You can imagine that people in their 40s or 50s who survived (the) Holocaust and remembered how it began,\" she said. \"They felt (goose bumps), and they understood that they don't know how it might end, but they have been through something like this again.\"\n\nThe communist government went after \"elites\" on college campuses as well as so-called Zionists.\n\nKonstanty Gebert was a Polish high school student in 1968 and described his story from that year as \"typical,\" which is chilling considering how he tells it.\n\n\"When the anti-Semitic campaign started, we started losing friends fast,\" he recounted to CNN, standing in downtown Warsaw last month where he \"got beaten up on the street for being a dirty Jew and then standing there, rubbing my face and wondering, 'What was that all about?'\"\n\nGebert, who is now a prominent journalist in Poland, got expelled from high school for being of \"Zionist extraction,\" he said.\n\nHis older sister left. Most of his friends left. His mother was \"de-Zionized\" from her job -- another anti-Semitic move cloaked in new language.\n\n\"We were a completely assimilated family. My father wasn't even Jewish. We never denied we (were) Jewish. It was that unimportant. I had friends who found out that they are Jewish only in '68 when the father would say, 'Well, son, you're old enough now to know that,' and here comes out the guilty secret. We didn't care,\" he recalled.\n\nGebert managed to stay in the country. Tens of thousands of others were not as lucky.\n\nThe communist government forced Jewish citizens to emigrate, said Fikus, who also serves on the board of the Jewish Historical Institute of Poland.\n\n\"They were deprived of their citizenship. They were told that they have to leave their home,\" she explained, pointing to a display case featuring a $5 bill -- the only amount of money they were allowed to carry -- and a one-way document that resembled a passport. But it wasn't a passport -- it was a special document.\n\n\"It meant that you could only leave Poland, and never come back,\" she said.\n\nBash's uncle, Alex Gelber, was one of some 13,000 Polish Jews who were given a one-way ticket out of his country.\n\nHe was 20 years old in 1968 and in medical school.\n\n\"It was very unpleasant because I was pulled out from this fairly protected environment to the situation in which I'm essentially, like, nobody,\" he recalled.\n\nThe Polish life he described before everything changed was not one of persecution, but relative privilege.\n\n\"We were young kids, and it was mostly partying, and having a good time. And actually, politics was really not on the horizon. And as far as I'm concerned, there is an issue of anti-Semitism that came up later. That, for myself, was essentially nonexistent. And so that was not an issue. Obviously, I knew that I was Jewish, and my friends knew that I was Jewish. But it was not a problem,\" Alex said.\n\nHis father, the late George Gelber, was a prominent doctor and professor in the western Polish city of Szczecin, where they moved after George survived World War II because he was helped and hidden from the Nazis by his Catholic professor and doctor in the community. He tended to children's medical needs, wrote academic papers and lived a relatively nice life considering they were behind the Iron Curtain.\n\n\"He was definitely well recognized as an excellent doctor,\" Alex said.\n\nBut none of that mattered in March 1968 during the communist government's purge of Polish Jews.\n\n\"My father, personally, he was given a choice. They say, 'You can resign by yourself, or we will fire you.' Obviously, it made no difference. And so he said, 'No. I am not going to resign. You have to tell me that I am not worth being here,'\" Alex recalled.\n\nIn the following days, Alex remembers a blur of packing and getting together with friends and family they thought they would never see again.\n\n\"You had an official who would stand over you and would say, 'Well, you can take this item or you can take this piece of whatever, some possession, jewelry or something, and then you cannot take the other,'\" he recalled, though he said his family was allowed to take a bit more than others because the mother of their customs official was one of his father's patients.\n\n\"There were a lot of scattered examples of humanity, but overall it was very unpleasant because you are a refugee,\" he said.\n\nThis uprooting came little more than 25 years after his parents barely survived the Nazis in Poland.\n\n\"They tried to build this semi-normal future, and it just didn't work well,\" Alex said.\n\nFor the large family on Alex's mother's non-Jewish side left behind in Poland, it was also traumatic.\n\nWojciech Zaremba, Alex's cousin, was only a boy in 1968, but he remembers it.\n\n\"It was unexpected. It was very, very rapid. And so, it was a kind of shock, but what was even worse after that, we lost contact. Because, remember, there was no internet; there was no ability to call. We were behind the Iron Curtain. We had no news, no messages. ... It was like a disappearance of this, in a very rapid way,\" he said.\n\nTo this day, he said he can't believe the Poles kicked out people like George Gelber, who spent his life tending to the health of the country, especially in Szczecin, which only became part of Poland after World War II.\n\n\"There were no established networks; the proper services, the proper care. ... He was un-replaceable, basically, but still, this was the most political reason for him to leave,\" said Zaremba.\n\nThe plight of the refugee. Where do we go?\n\nGeorge and Anna Gelber made their way to New York in 1969 to stay with relatives and slowly build a new life.\n\nAlex's sister, Renata Greenspan, had already finished medical school in Poland and also went to the United States. She joined the US Army, rose in rank to colonel and shattered glass ceilings as the first female director at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.\n\nAlex finished medical school in Italy and then joined his parents in New York, which is where he met my aunt Dr. Linda Wolf in 1981, while both were working at Bellevue Hospital.\n\nAlex's story has a happy ending, but the memory of being forced from his home, his country, his life, still lingers. \"This passage abroad,\" he recalled, \"leaves the mark that doesn't leave you.\"\n\nLike the tens of thousands who were forced to leave Poland in 1968, Alex views today's conflict through the lens of a former refugee.\n\n\"It's uncannily similar,\" he said of the refugee crisis in Ukraine. \"It's the same thing. It's this hate and (intolerance). And they drive people out, and people are desperate, and they don't know when will they come back?\"\n\n\"No person who underwent that experience would be very much against immigration,\" he continued, \"because that's how it should be done. When people are persecuted, they should be accepted in other places, in spite of all the things that can otherwise happen.\"\n\nAs Alex watches this new wave of refugees find shelter in a country that could not offer him the same, he is hopeful this is a lesson learned for Poland.\n\n\"They're ordinary people who opened their homes, and they let people move in -- so this is heartening. And that is, I guess, a source for hope.\"", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/04/14/me101.tuchman.1967/", "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/10/politics/ukrainian-refugees-poland-mental-health/index.html", "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/29/politics/ukraine-war-week-that-changed/index.html"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": null, "name": "Abbie Sharpe"}, {"id": "488d01b30f8b4506a6b8548a4034c694", "name": "Dana Bash"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Poland", "weight": 0.07415555}, {"name": "non-Jewish", "weight": 0.061882544}, {"name": "Jewish", "weight": 0.05670004}, {"name": "Jewish citizens", "weight": 0.056325696}, {"name": "World War II", "weight": 0.05467714}, {"name": "Ukrainian refugees", "weight": 0.05414478}, {"name": "Polish Jews", "weight": 0.05265615}, {"name": "anti-Semitic", "weight": 0.051226135}, {"name": "refugees", "weight": 0.05114446}, {"name": "anti-Semitic campaign", "weight": 0.05099648}], "topics": [{"name": "Poland"}], "categories": [{"name": "Politics"}], "entities": [{"data": "CNN", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "SS", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "the Jewish Historical Institute of Poland", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Bellevue Hospital", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the No\u017cyk Synagogue", "type": "FAC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "World War II", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "the Vietnam War", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Holocaust", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Jewish", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 18}, {"data": "Nazis", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "anti-Semitic", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Polish", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 7}, {"data": "Ukrainian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "communists", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "American", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Zionists", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Semitism", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Catholic", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Poles", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Poland", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 16}, {"data": "Warsaw", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "New York", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Szczecin", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "the United States", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Italy", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ukraine", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Michael Schudrich", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Dana Bash's", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Joanna Fikus", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Gomu\u0142ka", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Konstanty Gebert", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Alex Gelber", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 13}, {"data": "George Gelber", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Wojciech Zaremba", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Anna Gelber", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Renata Greenspan", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Linda Wolf", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.030033164, "negative": 0.57938457, "neutral": 0.39058223}, "summary": "Because SS soldiers used the No\u017cyk Synagogue as a warehouse and horse stable during World War II, it was the only major Jewish synagogue the Nazis did not destroy in Poland's capital city of Warsaw.

"Scholz defends Ukraine policy as criticism mounts in Germany", "description": "Scholz defends Ukraine policy as criticism mounts in Germany  The Guardian", "content": "The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has defended himself against accusations that his approach to Russian aggression has been hesitant and timid, insisting his decisions followed close consultation with Germany\u2019s allies and sought to avoid any suspicion that the country was \u201cgoing it alone\u201d.\n\nScholz has faced fierce criticism even from within his own government and last week came under particular fire from the opposition leader, Friedrich Merz, who accused him of weak leadership and of \u201cprocrastination, dithering and timidity\u201d. On Sunday it was reported that Merz was planning to travel to Kyiv on Monday.\n\nScholz appeared to bow to immense domestic and international pressure last week by announcing that Germany would deliver heavy weaponry to Ukraine, in the form of self-propelled anti-aircraft systems, in what was seen as a sharp policy U-turn.\n\nBut while the outspoken Ukrainian ambassador to Berlin, Andriy Melnyk, said he welcomed the move, he piled further pressure on Scholz on Sunday by insisting it did not go nearly far enough, and demanding more \u201cfantasy and courage\u201d from Germany.\n\nResponding to the criticism in an interview with the tabloid Bild am Sonntag, Scholz said: \u201cI am making my decisions quickly and in conjunction with our allies.\u201d He said that \u201coverhasty actions and Germany going it alone\u201d would be viewed with suspicion.\n\nScholz said: \u201cI am not fearful enough to allow myself to be affected by such accusations.\u201d He insisted he would not be cowed into changing his strategy by his record-low popularity rating.\n\n\u201cYou should notice opinion polls but you should not make your actions dependent on them. Especially regarding questions of war and peace, this would be immensely dangerous,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the polling institute Insa, 54% of Germans are unhappy with Scholz\u2019s record.\n\nScholz, who has been in office for just under five months, found himself plunged early on into dealing with the dilemma faced by almost every government leader since the second world war \u2013 having to tread a thin line between Germany assuming international responsibilities and avoiding accusations both at home and abroad that its actions might drag Europe into another war.\n\nMelnyk, who has himself drawn criticism within Germany for his persistent complaints about what he has repeatedly described as the country\u2019s lack of decisive action, said that the Gepard anti-aircraft guns promised last week were insufficient and too old.\n\n\u201cThe direction is the right one, but of course they are not enough. In particular we\u2019re lacking ammunition for the Gepards ... and in addition they are 40 years old. In order to defeat Russia we need the most modern Germany weaponry,\u201d he said, also speaking to Bild.\n\nHe said his criticism was directed at \u201cthe entire German political class\u201d, accusing Germany of being \u201cvery wrapped up in itself\u201d and urging it to \u201cat last become aware of its enormous historical responsibility\u201d.\n\nMelnyk listed the specific arms he said Ukraine needed Germany to deliver. \u201cWe want the speedy export of 88 Leopard tanks, 100 Marder armoured personnel carriers, self-propelled howitzers and much more. We are experiencing the biggest war in Europe for 80 years. It cannot be won with 30 or 100 more anti-aircraft systems.\u201d\n\nMelnyk acknowledged that Germany had taken in a large number of refugees from Ukraine, including his own mother-in-law. Officially the figure is just under 400,000, according to German border police, although the real number is believed to be much higher as they are not required to register and can be in Germany without a visa for 90 days.\n\n\u201cI am grateful to Germany for every help it gives. But we\u2019re talking about life and death in Ukraine, and the survival of my nation,\u201d he said.\n\nAs debate raged among policymakers in Germany as to when and whether Germany can become independent from Russian gas supplies, the news agency DPA reported that the government was planning to support EU plans for a Russian oil embargo, as part of a sixth round of sanctions about to be announced by the bloc, despite opposition from Hungary, Austria, Slovakia, Spain, Italy and Greece.\n\nGermany has already reduced its dependence on Russian gas from 55% to 35% since the start of the

affect the timing of a second independence referendum, Nicola Sturgeon has said, as she refused to rule out court action after Scotland\u2019s information commissioner ordered her government to publish its legal advice on holding a second poll.\n\nThe Scottish National party leader and first minister also challenged the UK government to take a four nations approach to mitigating the cost of living crisis, just as happened during the pandemic.\n\nAmid growing fears that the Russia-Ukraine conflict will continue into next year, Sturgeon said: \u201cI\u2019ve not changed my position on the timescale we won the mandate for in the election last year.\u201d\n\nSturgeon was speaking on board the SNP\u2019s canary yellow campaign bus after knocking on doors around Glasgow with candidates for this Thursday\u2019s council elections. The party\u2019s local manifesto includes a reiteration of its 2021 Holyrood election commitment to hold a second independence referendum by the end of 2023.\n\nThere has been increasing speculation that the ongoing war in Europe could impact this timetable, and that the party\u2019s stance on a Trident-free independent Scotland is out of step with public mood at a time of international conflict.\n\nSturgeon acknowledged that \u201ceverybody in the European Union is fundamentally rethinking defence and security\u201d but insists this does not amount to the need for a more flexible policy around nuclear weapons post-independence.\n\n\u201cMy party is very strongly in principle and for practical reasons against nuclear weapons, and that\u2019s not going to change. We\u2019ve got to remember that the vast majority of countries in the world don\u2019t have nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nThe question of Nato membership has divided nationalist opinion - the SNP changed policy in 2012 to remaining within the alliance if Scotland becomes independent, prompting the resignation of 3 MSPs. Sturgeon said her party has to be \u201cmuch more engaged\u201d in the question of what an independent Scotland would bring to Nato. \u201cWhat would be the specialisms and the expertise that we could put on the table, to be a much much more constructive partner in that security alliance?\u201d\n\nLast week, Scotland\u2019s Information Commissioner ordered Sturgeon\u2019s government to publish its legal advice on whether it would have the requisite powers to hold a second referendum without Westminster\u2019s consent \u2013 which Boris Johnson has consistently refused \u2013 following a lengthy FOI battle with the Scotsman. Are ministers planning to publish that information or challenge the ruling in court?\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner\u2019s made his ruling, there\u2019s now a June 10 deadline, any government is going to carefully consider all aspects of that and I\u2019m not going to pre-empt that consideration,\u201d said Sturgeon.\n\n\u201cThe question is not whether the Scottish government will comply with the law. We will. The question is whether political opponents and actually democrats are willing to argue their case democratically and allow the people to decide\u201d.\n\nThe SNP, the largest party of local government and now in power at Holyrood for 15 years, is facing serious challenges to its reputation for competence, including delays and mismanagement of vital ferry services and soaring NHS waiting times while there has been outcry at funding cuts handed down to local services following the latest Scottish budget.\n\nBut latest polling suggests that the party will maintain its dominance, although the latest Panelbase tracker for the Sunday Times has support for the party down six points since last November.\n\nScottish Labour is expected to push the Conservatives into third place, as pro-union voters react to Partygate. But with the constitution continuing to steer voter choice, elections expert Sir John Curtice has pointed out that every poll in Scotland is a \u201cquasi-referendum\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe anger about Partygate, feeding into and being fed by the anger and genuine distress people are feeling about the cost of living is palpable,\u201d said Sturgeon.\n\nShe was dismissive of the latest comments by Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross that Johnson was \u201cfit for office\u201d, despite previously calling for the prime minister to resign.\n\n\u201cHe got, rightly, some credit for doing that \u2013 not easy within his own party \u2013 but then to make the U-turn he\u2019s made and now argue against all evidence to the contrary that Boris Johnson is actually fit to be prime minister, makes him look unprincipled, inconsistent, lacking resolve and a bit silly.\u201d\n\nAt her party\u2019s council manifesto launch, Sturgeon promised a \u201cpandemic-level\u201d response to the cost of living crisis, highlighting the doubling of the new weekly child payment for low income families, the council tax reduction scheme and efforts to reduce fuel poverty.\n\nNow she is calling for a concerted four-nations effort, as happened throughout the Covid crisis, a point she says she raised last week with Michael Gove.\n\n\u201cInevitably that has to involve much more action on the part of the UK government because most of the resources and levers do lie there \u2026 I suggested we haven\u2019t proper four nations discussion with actual proposals on the table from all four nations with the Treasury there, properly engaged.\u201d\n\nScotland elects councillors by proportional representation, making coalitions and minority administrations the norm, but Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, has ruled out deals with other parties.\n\n\u201cWhat that says to me,\u201d she said, \u201cis that Anas Sarwar is a politician deep in opposition mindset, that he is not somebody who is yet anywhere close to thinking about what it means to be in power and take responsibility\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn an STV election, if you have that position then you\u2019re effectively freezing yourself in

Afghanistan to its immediate south, Ukraine further West to mention just a few. None of it is of their own making, which is the good news. Russia, its biggest trading partner, is being sanctioned to smithereens because of its war in Ukraine. China, the No. 1 source of its imports and No. 3 export destination, is facing a resurgence of Covid-19 in its busiest corporate city \u2013 Shanghai. In the middle of this, Uzbekistan decides to throw its first-ever international investor conference.\n\nThe Tashkent International Investor Forum took place between March 24 and 26. The meeting was moderated by the Director of Communications of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Jonathan Charles, formerly a well-known BBC World News anchor.\n\nOver the last few years, starting in 2016, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev has launched a series of economic reforms and declared the country open for business. He was joined at the Investment Forum by the leaders of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, the Asian Development Bank and by officials from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, among others.\n\nThe main topics at the forum were about restoring and stimulating the development of economic activity in post-Covid Uzbekistan; reducing poverty; regulating monetary policy; supporting private business and privatization of state-owned companies and developing the banking sector and the financial market.\n\n\u201cI am a big fan of the new Uzbekistan although it\u2019s still largely unknown to people in the west,\u201d famed investor Jim Rogers told me in August. \u201cIt used to be run like a dictatorship, but the new government seems to know what they are doing. What they have achieved in the last few years deserves commendation.\u201d\n\nSome of those achievements include getting rid of forced labor in Uzbekistan\u2019s cotton plantations, privatizing state assets (still in the works) and reforming the judicial system. They debuted their first-ever Eurobond in 2019. Interest rates there are 17%. Their bonds are all double B speculative-grade credit. Twelve-month rolling consumer price inflation is around 9.7% as of February.\n\nOn April 13, the International Monetary Fund published a report from their country visit. They said that Uzbekistan has weathered the pandemic \u201crelatively well\u201d.\n\nStrong fundamentals, ample policy buffers (room to cut interest rates), and high gold prices allowed the authorities to take decisive actions to mitigate the social and economic impact of the pandemic, while maintaining economic stability at a time when the world seems to be crumbling all around them.\n\nSuffice to say that Afghanistan is next door.\n\nThe economic recovery Uzbekistan started in late-2020 gained momentum in 2021, with growth accelerating to 7.4%.\n\nBut just as it appeared that Uzbekistan had moved past the acute phase of the pandemic and was ready to go back to business, the war in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia have brought new uncertainty and weighed on Uzbekistan\u2019s outlook, the IMF said.\n\nRussia is a large source of remittances from Uzbeks living there and sending money back home. It is also a source of financing, especially in the energy and mining sectors. Spillovers from Russia and Kazakhstan crises, coupled with disruptions in the China supply chain, will mean new headwinds for Uzbekistan at a time when it is over the drama and ready to move on.\n\n\u201cVolatility and uncertainty are expected to remain elevated for some time,\u201d the IMF report stated.\n\nWith the new headwinds, Uzbekistan\u2019s growth is expected to slow to 4% this year, down from 6% projected earlier. Inflation will rise again, seen hitting 12% thanks to sanctions on Russian commodity producers and China\u2019s zero Covid policy closing the world\u2019s biggest port.\n\nEveryone wants a breath of fresh air. This is especially true for countries that have been put through the ringer. Uzbekistan has been on pause since the fall of the Soviet Union. It didn\u2019t know what to do with itself. Mirziyoyev who came to power in 2016 is heralded by the West as the man who might change that.\n\nDuring a March 9 meeting with the Uzbek Foreign Minister Abdulaziz Kamilov, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, \u201cWe appreciate the strategic partnership between Uzbekistan and the United States and all the work that\u2019s being done through that.\u201d\n\nThat partnership is about twenty years old now. It still is mainly a political arrangement due to its border with war-torn Afghanistan, its close ties to Russia, and its geostrategic location. However, Washington is also interested in having a friend in a former Soviet space and doing business. That\u2019s something the private sector will have to believe in.\n\nAt the forum last month, Mirziyoyev basically took the time to describe an ancient world trying to get plugged into the new one.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been known since ancient times for the fact that there were caravan routes connecting different parts of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a mutual enrichment of civilizations and cultures formed in China, India, Iran, Byzantium, and Egypt. Our country with more than 3,000 years of statehood, has long been one of the world\u2019s highly developed centers of trade, economy, science, culture, and art.\u201d\n\nFor the history buffs in the market, Mirziyoyev mentioned Abu Ali Ibn Sino \u2014 or Avicenna as he is called in Europe. He was one of the early founders of modern medicine and implemented the practice of quarantine.\n\nMuhammad Khwarizmi was an early mathematician, and the term algorithm is linked to him.\n\nThe local ruler, a grandson of Tamerlane, and the founder of an observatory Mirzo Ulugbek built an observatory in Samarkand in the 15th century.\n\nThat was then.\n\nUzbekistan now is a frontier market for alternative investors and risk-takers like Rogers.\n\nBusiness has picked up. Volume of annual foreign direct investments tripled since Mirziyoyev took over in 2016. He is the country\u2019s second president. FDI reached $25 billion last year, with about 59 thousand investment projects implemented over the last six years and more than 2.5 million new jobs created as a result of this opening up, according to government numbers.\n\nOver the next five years, Uzbekistan\u2019s government says it aims to reach a $100 billion GDP, double exports to exceed $30 billion, and have 80% of GDP produced by the private sector. By 2030 or earlier, Uzbekistan wants to join WTO, and become a country with GDP per capita in the upper middle-income level. That\u2019s only 8 years from now. If they were to do that, they would have to become the Singapore of Central Asia.\n\nGlobal corporations and dealmakers see the country as a promising opportunity zone in Eurasia, as all new markets are.\n\nThe country recently got on Europe\u2019s generalized system of preferences (GSP+) for certain products that can be shipped will lower duty costs.\n\nPrivatization of state assets in more than 25 sectors is expected to occur between now and 2026.\n\nFor the locals, there has been a reduction in the total number of taxes from 13 to 9. And the property tax rates have been reduced by over three times from 5% to 1.5%. Personal income taxes went from a whopping 40% down to 20%. Capital gains taxes are around 10%, based on PriceWaterhouseCoopers data.\n\n\u201cOur work over the past 5 years has yielded positive results,\u201d Mirziyoyev told forum participants from some 50 different countries. The average annual growth of the economy under this new government has been around 5%, with industrial growth averaging around 8%. Their central bank\u2019s foreign currency reserves rose from $27 billion to $35 billion, which is still small, but is equal to around $1,000 per person. In Brazil, central bank reserves are equal to around $1,600 per person, with total reserves of $357.8 billion as of February.\n\nIn 2020, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, Uzbekistan\u2019s economy did much better than Brazil\u2019s, which saw negative GDP. Last year, GDP growth in Uzbekistan exceeded 7%.\n\n\u201cThis inspires us to go after new frontiers,\u201d Mirziyoyev said at the conference. He wants Uzbekistan to be a transportation corridor to export goods east, via a railroad to Kyrgyzstan and China, south via Afghanistan, and west via a multi-modal transportation corridor through the South Caucasus.\n\nUzbekistan reportedly signed deals and investment agreements worth $7.8 billion at the forum, including preliminary agreements, or memorandums of understanding, estimated to be worth $3.5 billion.\n\nOf course, China was there with their Uzbek-Chinese sideline forum titled \u201cIndustrial Cooperation. New Opportunities.\u201d\n\nAnd neighboring Kazakhstan is in crisis. Their First Deputy Foreign Minister Akan Rakhmetullin said to the European media in mid-April that \u201cThe United States has imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia. We have deep integration with Russia, as well as the longest land border, and cannot not feel the impact of these sanctions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe economy has finally opened up and I am sure international investors will use this opportunity to tap into its growth potential,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cI\u2019ll be watching closely.\u201d\n\nUzbekistan intends to make this an annual investor

Volunteers all, they enlist with local brigades and fight in their home regions with only minimal training and equally minimal equipment.\n\nThey don\u2019t always have standard uniforms, trucks and radios\u2014to say nothing of heavy weaponry. But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re entirely lacking firepower.\n\nTo give the territorials some chance of blunting Russian attacks, Kyiv has armed at least some of its two dozen territorial brigades\u2014one each for every major free city\u2014with a type of big gun that, in almost any other army, would be on display at a museum.\n\nThe MT-12 towed anti-tank gun. Hundreds of copies of which were lying around in Ukrainian warehouses before the current war.\n\nThe three-ton MT-12, firing a high-velocity, 100-millimeter-diameter shell from a smoothbore tube, is getting a hard workout by the territorials as they hold the line against the latest Russian offensives in southern and eastern Ukraine.\n\nA video that circulated on social media on Friday depicts volunteers with the 110th Territorial Brigade from Zaporizhia, 100 miles northwest of Mariupol, furiously firing their MT-12 at nearby Russian or separatist forces.\n\nThe gun\u2019s flat elevation means the enemy might be just a mile away, at most. At that range, an MT-12 can penetrate 400 millimeters of armor\u2014enough to destroy an infantry fighting vehicle and, from certain angles, disable or destroy a tank.\n\nThe Friday video isn\u2019t the first evidence of the MT-12 in Ukrainian service. Videos and photos from earlier in the war confirm at least three MT-12s that the Ukrainians abandoned and the Russians captured, plus another that the Russians destroyed in combat.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Russian-backed Ukrainian separatists also use MT-12s\u2014and have abandoned at least one of the guns, so far.\n\nThe MT-12 is not a complex weapon. That\u2019s a good thing, as it requires only a little training to operate and only basic supply and support to keep it in action. Perfect for the 100,000 aging former taxi-drivers, teachers and factory workers who comprise the Ukrainian territorials.\n\nSoviet industry developed the MT-12 in the early 1960s as a complement to the heavier self-propelled howitzers then becoming common. While howitzers in Soviet army doctrine were offensive weapons\u2014indeed, the main offensive weapons\u2014MT-12s were defensive.\n\nAnti-tank companies using MT-LB tracked vehicles as tractors would array their six each guns along a brigade\u2019s flanks in order to defend against counterattacking enemy tanks. An experienced, six-person MT-12 crew could set up its gun within a minute and shoot a round every 10 seconds or so.\n\nUkraine possessed as many as 500 old, Soviet-vintage MT-12s when Russia attacked the night of Feb. 23. It\u2019s unclear exactly how Kyiv has distributed the guns. On paper, many of the Ukrainian army\u2019s active brigades include MT-12s that could perform direct- and indirect-fire missions.\n\nIn practice, the best brigades tend to assign self-propelled 2S1 122-millimeter howitzes to indirect-fire missions and anti-tank teams with Stugna-P missiles to direct-fire missions.\n\nThat may have freed up MT-12s for the growing number of territorial formations. Photos of the 110 Territorial Brigade in German magazine Der Spiegel in late April depict a six-man gun crew riding on an MT-LB stacked high with crates of ammo and towing an MT-12.\n\nThe Der Spiegel article mentions just two guns, perhaps hinting at the loose\u2014and minimal\u2014structure of the territorials\u2019 artillery. They might just take what they can get and use it however they can.\n\nMore and better guns are coming, although not necessarily for the territorials. The United States and its NATO allies together have pledged to Ukraine around 200 modern artillery pieces, including some of the latest European self-propelled howitzers that are compatible with American-made laser-guided shells.\n\nExpect those guns to go to active brigades and newly-mobilized reserve brigades. The territorials still might benefit, however, if new donated kit replaces older Soviet kit\u2014and the old stuff cascades down to second-line units.\n\nToday the 11oth makes do with 60-year-old anti-tank guns. Tomorrow it might get self-propelled howitzers from some tank brigade that just reequipped with ex-Dutch PzH-2000s.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/tedreed/2021/09/23/american-airlines-pilots-say-operations-managers-must-go-after-summer-breakdowns/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2022/04/28/where-is-ukraines-southern-counteroffensive/?sh=3e4272596eef", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2022/04/27/ukraines-artillery-might-be-winning-the-war-with-russia/?sh=2f726b4d3b48", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2021/09/27/an-american-bomber-visited-malaysia-a-bizarre-mix-of-local-jets-rose-to-meet-it/", "https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-ukrainian.html", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2021/09/27/the-us-air-force-is-gradually-rebuilding-its-b-52-bombers-from-the-rivets-out/", "https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1520227880755679234", "https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/russia-ramps-up-the-pressure-in-eastern-ukraine-we-have-never-seen-such-firepower-a-d99a0a95-49c2-4c43-807b-64f034ab53db"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": "eb32d8a3457c4c1db3ed420ab8cc80c5", "name": "David Axe"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "towed anti-tank gun", "weight": 0.09870296}, {"name": "Anti-tank companies", "weight": 0.08421336}, {"name": "big gun", "weight": 0.0802303}, {"name": "ex-Dutch PzH-2000s", "weight": 0.07781347}, {"name": "active brigades", "weight": 0.075881705}, {"name": "ex-Dutch", "weight": 0.07382069}, {"name": "local brigades", "weight": 0.07188688}, {"name": "counterattacking enemy tanks", "weight": 0.066192485}, {"name": "MT-12s", "weight": 0.05638527}, {"name": "only minimal training", "weight": 0.055915695}], "topics": [{"name": "Crime"}, {"name": "Ukraine"}, {"name": "Russia-Ukraine War"}], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "Ukraine", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Kyiv", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Zaporizhia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Mariupol", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Russia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "The United States", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Russian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "Ukrainian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "Soviet", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "German", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "European", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "American", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "The MT-12 towed", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 13}, {"data": "The three-ton MT-12,", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "their MT-12 at", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "2S1", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Stugna-P", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "11oth", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the 110th Territorial Brigade", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Der Spiegel", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "NATO", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "ex-Dutch", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "a minute", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "every 10 seconds", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the night of Feb. 23", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.042693358, "negative": 0.26243916, "neutral": 0.6948675}, "summary": "Volunteers all, they enlist with local brigades and fight in their home regions with only minimal training and equally minimal equipment. \n\nThe MT-12 towed anti-tank gun. \n\nAnti-tank companies using MT-LB tracked vehicles as tractors would array their six each guns along a brigade\u2019s flanks in order to defend against counterattacking enemy tanks.

It\u2019s better for you to survive in Russia than to perish on our land.\"\n\nHe said Russia has been recruiting new troops \u201cwith little motivation and little combat experience\" for units sent into battle early in the Russian invasion, only for those units to be gutted and thrown back into the war again.\n\n\u201cThe Russian commanders are lying to their soldiers when they tell them they can expect to be held seriously responsible for refusing to fight and then also don\u2019t tell them, for example, that the Russian army is preparing additional refrigerator trucks for storing the bodies.

Jolie has been a United Nations special envoy for refugees since 2011.\n\n\u25baThe bodies of three civilians found in another mass grave in Bucha outside Kyiv shows that they were tortured, the head of the regional police force Andriy Nebytov said Saturday.\n\nU.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised the courage of the Ukrainian people and vowed continued U.S. support to help Ukraine defeat Russia after leading a congressional delegation to Kyiv to assess Ukraine\u2019s needs for the next phase of the war. Pelosi, a California Democrat who is next in line to the presidency after the vice president, is the most senior American lawmaker to visit Ukraine since Russia\u2019s war began more than two months ago. The group met with President Zelenskyy for three hours.\n\n\"America stands with Ukraine. America will stand with Ukraine until victory is one. And will stand with our NATO allies,\" she said at a briefing in Rzesz\u00f3w, Poland.\n\nOn Saturday, reports said a small group of civilians were evacuated from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol where an estimated 1,000 civilians and more soldiers are holding out against Russian forces.\n\nThe United Nations has said it was trying to broker an evacuation plan for the people left behind, who are facing an increasingly dire situation.\n\nAccording to Russian state media outlets, a group of 19 adults and six children were evacuated from the steel plant. A Ukrainian commander, Capt. Svyatoslav Palamar confirmed that an evacuation convoy brought out women and children, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe situation in Mariupol, the Ukrainian port city that has been under siege by Russian attacks, is like a \"Russian concentration camp among the ruins,\" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said late Friday.\n\nPeople in the Azovstal steel plant, the last holdout still under Ukrainian control in the city, are protected to an extent by underground bunkers in the Soviet-era facility. But Russians have been dropping \"bunker buster\" bombs.\n\nAt an 18-day training camp in Kosovo, a group of Ukrainian women is learning how to identify and defuse explosives, a need brought about by Russian forces leaving booby traps behind in the streets of Ukraine's cities.\n\nThe women are preparing for what to do after combat. While it is impossible to assess how littered with mines and unexploded ordnance Ukraine is at the moment, the aftermaths of other conflicts suggest the problem will be huge.\n\n\u201cIn many parts of the world, explosive remnants of war continue to kill and maim thousands of civilians each year during and long after active hostilities have ended. The majority of victims are children,\u201d the International Committee of the Red Cross testified at a December U.N. conference.\n\nMeanwhile, just outside Lviv on Saturday, volunteers in the Territorial Defense Forces were learning battlefield first aid and combat skills, The New York Times reported.\n\nA Russian rocket attack destroyed an airport runway in Odesa, Ukraine\u2019s third-largest city and a key Black Sea port, the Ukrainian army said Saturday.\n\nIn a Telegram post, Ukraine\u2019s Operational Command South said there was no way that the Odesa runway could be used as a result of the rocket attack.\n\nLocal authorities urged residents of the area to shelter in place as Ukrainian news agency UNIAN, citing army sources, reported that \u201cseveral\u201d explosions were heard in Odesa.\n\nOdesa\u2019s regional governor said that the rocket was fired from Russian-occupied Crimea.

He was convicted of espionage and sentenced to 16 years hard labour.\n\nThe other is Brittney Griner, a basketball star who was detained in a Moscow airport on 17 February, a week before the Ukraine invasion, and accused of having cannabis oil in her possession. A court has ordered her held until 19 May, pending investigation.\n\nFor both, the news of Reed\u2019s release brought mixed emotions: it showed that such deals are possible, but also the regret that they were excluded on this occasion.\n\n\u201cAs I do everything in my power to get BG home, my heart is overflowing with joy for the Reed family,\u201d Griner\u2019s wife, Cherelle, wrote on Instagram. \u201cI do not personally know them, but I do know the pain of having your loved one detained in a foreign country. That level of pain is constant and can only be remedied by a safe return home. For the Reed family, that day is today.\u201d\n\nIn a call from a penal colony, Whelan telephoned his parents and asked: \u201cWhy was I left behind?\n\n\u201cWhile I am pleased Trevor is home with his family, I have been held on a fictitious charge of espionage for 40 months,\u201d he said, according to his twin brother, David. \u201cThe world knows this charge was fabricated. Why hasn\u2019t more been done to secure my release.\u201d\n\nReflecting on the double-edged lessons from Reed\u2019s release, David Whelan said: \u201cIt\u2019s a \u201cfog of war\u201d experience. You don\u2019t really have any idea what\u2019s possible, and then with Trevor\u2019s release, you start to get a little bit of clarity that the US government is willing to take certain actions and how they might go about those actions.\n\n\u201cThe other benefit is that the fact that the exchange happened means that the US and Russian relationship, as damaged as it is, still has enough diplomatic life that they are able to spend a couple of months working out an arrangement like this,\u201d Whelan added.\n\nThe potential downside for the Whelan and Griner families is that, by exchanging Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot serving a 20-year sentence in federal prison for conspiracy to bring drugs into the US, Washington has traded someone designated as a bargaining counter by Moscow. US press reports of the months of negotiations leading up to the Reed release said that the Russians had insisted on Yaroshenko.\n\nJoe Biden said after the exchange that \u201cnegotiations that allowed us to bring Trevor home required difficult decisions that I do not take lightly\u201d.\n\nAccording to David Whelan, the Russian officers who oversaw his brother\u2019s detention made clear from early on that they hoped to swap him for Yaroshenko or Viktor Bout. Bout is a notorious Russian arms dealer, nicknamed the \u201cmerchant of death\u201d, who was arrested in Thailand in 2008, extradited to the US, and sentenced in 2012 to 25 years for conspiracy to kill US citizens, delivery of anti-aircraft missiles, and providing aid to a terrorist organisation.\n\nA source involved in hostage negotiations said that the Reed-Yaroshenko exchange opened the way for a possible swap of Bout for Whelan.\n\n\u201cThere is often a staggered process in these types of cases that is designed to build confidence,\u201d the source said. \u201cYou get him out, they do the trade, everybody sees that it worked, you wait to see what the blowback is, and then you\u2019ve already cut the deal for when the second trade will happen.\u201d\n\nDavid Whelan however, made clear that his family is not pushing for any such deal.\n\n\u201cMy personal man-on-the-street perspective is that it would be crazy for the US government to exchange the \u201cmerchant of death\u201d for Paul, who is, at best, a hapless tourist,\u201d he said.\n\nThe evidence used against Paul Whelan was a computer flash drive, which the prosecution said contained state secrets, and which he said was used to frame him. He was given the drive by an acquaintance and had assumed it contained just wedding photos.\n\nWhelan has now been held for 40 months, the last 20 of which have been in a labour camp in Mordovia, about 300 miles east of Moscow. For the whole of that time, his brother said, he has been roused from sleep every two hours at night and photographed, on the grounds he is a flight risk.\n\nThe decisive factor in the decision to prioritise Reed and exchange him for Yaroshenko was his failing health. He had been in the same cell as a prisoner with tuberculosis and had been coughing up blood. His family also conducted a high-profile pressure campaign, pressuring the White House to give his parents a public meeting with Biden.\n\nThe stock advice given to families of kidnap victims used to keep silent during negotiations, but now the hostage-taker is more likely to be a state than a rogue group, the landscape has changed.\n\n\u201cGoing public is an excellent way to influence states and a really poor way to influence terrorist groups or non-state actors,\u201d said Joel Simon, former head of the Committee to Protect Journalists and author of the 2019 book We Want to Negotiate: The Secret World of Kidnapping, Hostages and Ransom.\n\n\u201cSo if the key to resolving your hostage crisis is to influence a government, then going public may be the best strategy.\u201d\n\nWhile a few years ago, families would largely find themselves leading a public campaign more or less alone, there is now an expanding group of former hostages willing to help. On Trevor Reed\u2019s release, his family immediately declared they were transferring their efforts to Whelan and Griner.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the case six or seven years ago,\u201d said Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post journalist who has held on trumped-up charges for 544 days by the Iranian authorities.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s much more of a community which is the lone silver lining in this whole thing. Because without that community, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to solve this problem.\u201d", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia",

They also say it could lower reliance on Russian coking coal in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHowever, influential figures in the steel industry have become increasingly frustrated about the claims \u2013 with the two domestic steel producers understood to be unlikely to be significant customers for the mine\u2019s coal. Chris McDonald, chief executive of the Materials Processing Institute, which serves as the UK\u2019s national centre for steel research, said there was no demand from his industry for the West Cumbria mine.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a frustration hearing other industries speaking on behalf of the steel industry when the steel industry itself has not come out to say that it wants this mine,\u201d he told the Observer. \u201cI would contend that there isn\u2019t a demand for it. The case for the mine has been built around the need for coking coal produced in the UK for the UK steel industry. That\u2019s the case that the coal industry is making. But that doesn\u2019t stack up with the needs of the steel industry.\n\n\u201cThere are only two potential customers for this coal in the UK: Tata Steel and British Steel. British Steel have said they cannot use the coal from this mine because the sulphur levels are too high. Tata Steel have said if the coal were available, then they may or may not use a small amount. There isn\u2019t anyone in the steel industry who\u2019s calling for the mine.\u201d\n\nThe Woodhouse Colliery was initially approved by councillors in 2020. However, ministers intervened and launched an inquiry following opposition to the project, which grew in the run-up to the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow last year. Michael Gove is set to decide on whether to approve the mine by July. Recent reports have suggested he is minded to do so, although his department states no decision has been made.\n\nWest Cumbria Mining (WCM) has said the plan would create 530 permanent jobs, with 80% going to local people.\n\nMcDonald, who also chairs the UK Metals Council, questioned claims that the mine would lower reliance on Russian energy imports. Mike Starkie, the Conservative mayor of Copeland, which includes the proposed Whitehaven location of the mine, said the Ukraine invasion had \u201cdemonstrated why we need far more self-reliance for all of our natural resources\u201d. Local MP Trudy Harrison said the UK has \u201ctypically\u201d imported coking coal from Russia.\n\nMcDonald dismissed the claim. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to be clear that even if this mine opened tomorrow, it would not displace a single tonne of Russian coking coal from the UK \u2013 and I can say that with confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cTata Steel already does not use any Russian coking coal. British Steel have said they can\u2019t use the coal from Cumbria. So there\u2019s no possibility that it can displace any Russian imports.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got all of the big players in the European steel industry, with plans to gradually reduce their reliance on coking coal from 2030 onwards. If the mine were given approval tomorrow, I think it wouldn\u2019t open until 2026 or similar. So it\u2019s unlikely to have a very long life in that regard. There might be some other basis or some other case that somebody is making for the mine. From my view, as someone who\u2019s worked in the steel industry for 20 years and deals a lot in future steel technology, there isn\u2019t a demand from the steel industry for the mine.

We had a horrible plague \u2013 followed by two years of Covid.\u201d\n\nThat quip produced laughter. The next one elicited both laughter and groans: \u201cJust imagine if my predecessor came to this dinner this year. Now that would really have been a real coup if that occurred.\u201d\n\nThe gathering included the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and other cabinet members as well as journalists such as CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and MSNBC\u2019s Joy Reid. Celebrities including Kim Kardashian, Pete Davidson, Brooke Shields and Caitlyn Jenner walked the red carpet.\n\nThe three-course dinner took place in a vast, crowded hotel ballroom despite the long shadow cast by the pandemic. Biden, 79, skipped the meal with the 2,600 guests, all of whom had to provide proof of vaccination and a same day negative test.\n\nThe event was an opportunity for the president \u2013 or more precisely his speechwriters \u2013 to flex some comedy muscles at the expense of the media, the Republican party and his own ego\n\nHe began: \u201cA special thanks to the 42% of you who actually applauded. I\u2019m really excited to be here tonight with the only group of Americans with a lower approval rating than I have.\u201d\n\nThe president made fun of the hypocrisy of conservative cable channel Fox News, which has required its own employees to be vaccinated or tested daily, even as its prime time hosts rail against Biden\u2019s vaccine mandates.\n\n\u201cI know there are questions about whether we should gather here tonight, because of Covid. Well, we\u2019re here to show the country that we\u2019re getting through this pandemic. Plus, everyone had to prove they\u2019re fully vaccinated and boosted. So if you\u2019re home watching this, and you\u2019re wondering how to do that, just contact your favourite Fox News reporter. They\u2019re all here, vaccinated and boosted. All of them.\u201d\n\nHe also seized on recent revelations that Trump\u2019s White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity exchanged more than 80 text messages between the election day in 2020 and Biden\u2019s inauguration.\n\n\u201cFox News, I\u2019m really sorry your preferred candidate lost the last election. To make it up to you, I\u2019m happy to give my chief of staff to you all so he can tell Sean Hannity what to say every day.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the biggest laugh came when Biden made light of the \u201cLet\u2019s Go Brandon\u201d slogan, which has become rightwing code for swearing at him. \u201cRepublicans seem to support one fella, some guy named Brandon. He\u2019s having a really good year and I\u2019m kind of happy for him.\u201d\n\nWhen Biden shifted gear towards the end of his 14-minute speech to recognise the importance of journalism to American democracy, he again drew a contrast with his predecessor by insisting that a free press \u201cis not the enemy of the people\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhere the truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth, what\u2019s clear, and I mean this in the bottom of my heart, that you \u2013 the free press \u2013 matter more than you ever did in the last century,\u201d Biden said.\n\nHe added that \u201cAmerican democracy is not a reality show\u201d \u2013 seemingly another dig at Trump, former host of The Apprentice.\n\nIn another restoration of tradition, the president was obliged to sit as he was roasted by a comedian. South African Trevor Noah, host of Comedy Central\u2019s The Daily Show, told Biden: \u201cThank you for having me here. And I was a little confused on why me, but then I was told that you get your highest approval ratings when a biracial African guy is standing next to you.\u201d\n\nNoah also observed: \u201cEver since you came into office, things are already looking up. Gas is up, rent is up, food is up, everything.\u201d\n\nThe comedian took swipes at media personalities and the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis. He said of Kyrsten Sinema, a conservative Democratic senator who has helped to thwart much of Biden\u2019s legislative agenda: \u201cWho ever thought we\u2019d see the day when a senator could be openly bisexual but a closeted Republican?\u201d\n\nNoah wrapped up with a reference to Biden\u2019s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, telling the audience: \u201cPlease be careful leaving tonight. We all know this administration doesn\u2019t handle evacuations well.\u201d\n\nThe black tie dinner had other serious moments, with tributes to pioneer journalists of colour and aspiring student reporters. A sombre photo montage honouring journalists killed while covering the Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted a standing ovation.\n\nChris Coons, a Democratic senator and Biden ally, told the Guardian: \u201cAs it has always been in its best years in the past, this was an evening that was celebrating young journalists, celebrating seasoned journalists, celebrating pathbreaking journalists from a generation ago and mixed with a lot of humour, some hobnobbing, some celebrities.\n\n\u201cThe president played exactly the role we would hope a president would: a little bit of light humour, a very serious tribute to the importance of a free press and then sitting and listening as others poked fun at him.\u201d", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/fox-corporation-coronavirus-employees-vaccinations-daily-test-1235064641/", "https://www.c-span.org/2022-White-House-Correspondents-Association-Dinner/", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/06/kyrsten-sinema-filibuster-betrayed-arizona-voting-rights", "https://www.axios.com/trevor-noahs-best-white-house-correspondents-dinner-jokes-dbd17f43-3f30-4030-a995-e5785c9ad9ed.html", "https://www.axios.com/trump-reminder-stalin-enemy-of-people-f1e22406-5626-4747-ac61-28afde1b38f4.html", "https://www.coons.senate.gov/", "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/29/politics/hannity-text-messages-meadows-trump-white-house/index.html", "https://twitter.com/SmithInAmerica/status/1520613760293027840?s=20&t=Xd6zIN6kLqlOrPh5Kr_NCQ"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": "6d69565a010b4d4f8d5847a4f1eb3b50", "name": "David Smith"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Biden", "weight": 0.07214002}, {"name": "Biden ally", "weight": 0.07154041}, {"name": "Joe Biden", "weight": 0.06900671}, {"name": "conservative cable channel Fox News", "weight": 0.0689545}, {"name": "Fox News", "weight": 0.066577666}, {"name": "election day", "weight": 0.06239541}, {"name": "same day", "weight": 0.054860055}, {"name": "young journalists", "weight": 0.05196446}, {"name": "seasoned journalists", "weight": 0.05160164}, {"name": "pioneer journalists", "weight": 0.051572397}], "topics": [{"name": "Coronavirus"}, {"name": "Joe Biden"}, {"name": "Donald Trump"}], "categories": [{"name": "Politics"}], "entities": [{"data": "Joe Biden", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 12}, {"data": "Donald Trump", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Antony Blinken", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Jake Tapper", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Joy Reid", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Kim Kardashian", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Pete Davidson", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Brooke Shields", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Caitlyn Jenner", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Covid", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Mark Meadows", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Sean Hannity", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Brandon", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Trevor Noah", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Ron DeSantis", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Kyrsten Sinema", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Chris Coons", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Washington", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "US", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Florida", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Afghanistan", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ukraine", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "White House Correspondents\u2019 Association", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "state", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "CNN", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "MSNBC", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Republican party", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Fox News", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Comedy Central\u2019s", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Guardian", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Covid", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "tonight", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "14-minute", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "evening", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Americans", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Republicans", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "South African", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Democratic", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Russian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Let\u2019s Go Brandon\u201d", "type": "WORK_OF_ART", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Apprentice", "type": "WORK_OF_ART", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "The Daily Show", "type": "WORK_OF_ART", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.08618061, "negative": 0.10697706, "neutral": 0.8068423}, "summary": "\n\n\u201cThis is the first time the president has attended this dinner in six years,\u201d Biden observed.

One analyst said many would-be volunteers underestimated the danger from Russian forces.", "content": "Malcolm Nance, a U.S. Navy veteran serving in Ukraine\u2019s International Legion, contrasted the war in Ukraine with the American invasion of Iraq. \u201cYou\u2019re the hunted now,\u201d he said.\n\nThe deaths of three foreigners killed this week while fighting with Ukrainian forces has drawn renewed attention to thousands of largely unregulated volunteers who have gone to fight Russia\u2019s invasion, some of them accepted into an international legion. Among the dead was Willy Joseph Cancel Jr., 22, a correctional officer and a Marine Corps veteran who left Kentucky to fight with the Ukrainian army, his uncle said. Mr. Cancel\u2019s father was told that the former Marine had been killed when his Ukrainian unit was overrun by Russian troops this week, the uncle, Christopher Cancel, said. His body had not yet been recovered. A Ukrainian Defense Ministry official confirmed on Friday that an American, a Briton and a Dane had been killed fighting with the Ukrainian Army\u2019s International Legion. The official asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the deaths.\n\n\u201cThe armed forces pay tribute to the sacrifice of the foreign heroes who have come to protect the Ukrainian people from this barbarous invasion but also to defend freedom and democracy everywhere,\u201d the legion said in a statement. Malcolm Nance, a Navy intelligence veteran and former TV commentator who is now the public face of the legion, called the volunteers who died \u201cprotecting angels, along with all those people who lost their lives in this senseless Russian invasion.\u201d In an interview before the foreign fighters were killed, Mr. Nance said many would-be volunteers arriving in the country underestimated the danger from Russian forces. He said the war was unlike what American veterans may have experienced in the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq. \u201cYou\u2019re the hunted now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it is a full combined arms army with an enormous artillery machine that is there to chew you up.\u201d Ukraine and Russia have each had steep military losses, though their governments have not given specific figures. In mid-April, U.S. intelligence agencies estimated that 5,500 to 11,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed, and more than 18,000 wounded. Western intelligence agencies estimate that Russian military losses range from 7,000 to 10,000 killed and 20,000 to 30,000 wounded.\n\nAfter signing up a rush of volunteers at the start of the war, the International Legion recently has become much more selective in recruiting members, taking only those with combat experience who pass rigorous vetting, according to the legion\u2019s spokesman, Damien Magrou, a Norwegian lawyer. Mr. Magrou said the legion rejects a majority of applicants, but some of those who are turned down make their way to the front lines anyway, hoping to find another group to fight with. \u201cWe tell them there is a shuttle bus back to Poland, the best thing you can do is get a seat on it,\u201d he said. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine announced the formation of the legion on Feb. 27, three days after the invasion began, and invited foreign volunteers to come and fight. Ten days later the Ukrainian government said it had received 20,000 applications. Russian oil embargo. European Union countries are likely to approve a phased embargo on Russian oil, sealing a long-postponed measure that has divided the bloc\u2019s members and highlighted their dependence on Russian energy sources. E.U. ambassadors expect to give their final approval by the end of the week, officials said. On the ground. The Ukrainian military said that Russia was deploying forces normally based in the far east of its territory to the main battle front in Ukraine, a potential sign of the strain on Russian troops as they sustain heavy losses and face a well-armed resistance. An evacuation. About 20 women and children were evacuated from Mariupol\u2019s embattled Azovstal steel plant, the Ukrainian military\u2019s last foothold in the city. It remained unclear how many civilians remained inside the plant, which has been under heavy bombardment. An American casualty. Family members of Willy Joseph Cancel Jr., a U.S. citizen, confirmed that he had died fighting alongside Ukrainians. He is believed to be the first American killed in action. A Dane and a Briton have also died fighting for Ukraine since the start of the war, according to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry. The government has declined to say how many foreign volunteers there are in the country, but there are believed to be several thousand, most of them fighting with groups other than the International Legion.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/04/29/world/ukraine-russia-war-news/europe-ratchets-up-preparation-for-russian-oil-embargo-next-week?smid=url-copy&action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-russia-ukraine&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/29/world/europe/american-killed-ukraine-cancel.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/29/world/europe/europe-ratchets-up-preparation-for-russian-oil-embargo-next-week.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-russia-ukraine&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/14/world/europe/european-union-oil-embargo-russia-ukraine.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-russia-ukraine&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/world/ukraine-russia-donbas-offensive.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/29/world/europe/american-killed-ukraine-cancel.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-russia-ukraine&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/04/30/world/ukraine-russia-war-news/as-moscow-reinforces-its-troops-on-the-front-line-it-aims-to-keep-kyiv-from-doing-the-same?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-russia-ukraine&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.ohchr.org/en/news/2022/04/ukraine-civilian-casualty-update-21-april-2022", "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/04/30/world/ukraine-russia-war-news?name=styln-russia-ukraine&action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-russia-ukraine&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc&region=TOP_BANNER\u2588=storyline_menu_recirc&action=click&pgtype=Article&variant=show&is_new=false#mariupol-evacuation-steel-plant-ukraine"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": "cf6be4d316e64bfc947fbec841668f9d", "name": "Jane Arraf"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Russian forces", "weight": 0.08111819}, {"name": "Russian troops", "weight": 0.07669133}, {"name": "Russian military losses", "weight": 0.07610714}, {"name": "International Legion", "weight": 0.075373664}, {"name": "Russian energy sources", "weight": 0.07437344}, {"name": "Ukrainian forces", "weight": 0.074067384}, {"name": "Russian oil embargo", "weight": 0.07283682}, {"name": "Russian oil", "weight": 0.07255788}, {"name": "foreign volunteers", "weight": 0.07205491}, {"name": "Russian", "weight": 0.06897772}], "topics": [{"name": "Europe"}, {"name": "Ukraine"}, {"name": "Russia-Ukraine War"}], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "Malcolm Nance", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Willy Joseph Cancel Jr.", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Christopher Cancel", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Damien Magrou", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Volodymyr Zelensky", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "U.S. Navy", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "International Legion", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Marine Corps", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ukrainian Defense Ministry", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "European Union", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ukraine", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "Iraq", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Russia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Kentucky", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "U.S.", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Poland", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "E.U.", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Mariupol", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "American", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Ukrainian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 9}, {"data": "Marine", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Russian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 8}, {"data": "Briton", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Dane", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Norwegian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Azovstal", "type": "FAC", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.03941125, "negative": 0.5181259, "neutral": 0.44246286}, "summary": "Mr. Cancel\u2019s father was told that the former Marine had been killed when his Ukrainian unit was overrun by Russian troops this week, the uncle, Christopher Cancel, said.

The charred remnants of destroyed buildings that line miles of highway are testament to the intensity of the fighting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s helpful to drive because you get a real sense of what was going on \u2026 and it\u2019s truly shocking. But what is equally extraordinary is to see how Ukraine kept Russia out of Kyiv. Every way in which Ukraine has been able to do that is a thing to to celebrate and to treasure.\u201d\n\nMoscow has shifted its focus to a new offensive in the east and south after retreating from Kyiv, at least for now. \u201cI think Putin would certainly want to give it another try if he thought he was making progress,\u201d Simmons said.\n\nBut even in the east, after concentrating their forces for a new offensive, Russian\u2019s military has struggled. It is appearing to repeat some of the tactical mistakes it made around the capital and is bearing heavy losses on the frontline.\n\nAround the city of Kharkiv, Ukrainian forces made some gains against Russia, despite heavy shelling that killed one and injured five.\n\nThe Pentagon spokesperson, John Kirby, on Friday briefly choked with emotion as he described the destruction in Ukraine and denounced Putin\u2019s \u201cdepravity\u201d.\n\nUkrainian prosecutors say they have pinpointed more than 8,000 war crimes by Russian troops and are investigating 10 Russian soldiers for suspected atrocities in Bucha near Kyiv. It has been a month since the Ukrainian army pushed Russia out of the Kyiv region, yet police and volunteers are still finding new graves.\n\nThe gradual return of many western ambassadors to Kyiv has served as a show of confidence and solidarity for the government of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who on Friday welcomed Simmons back by name in his video address to the nation.\n\nPerhaps for that reason, Russia has threatened to target foreign diplomats in the capital, which it hit with missile strikes that killed a journalist during a visit by the UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterreslast week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not minimising it. I\u2019m not discounting it. You have to take it into account, but I\u2019m still here,\u201d Simmons said, pointing out that she was not a lone potential target.\n\n\u201c[There are 27 ambassadors here] so that\u2019s quite a lot of diplomats to target,\u201d she said. \u201cI am here with a heightened level of security protection and bearing in mind that potential risk, but for now I feel comfortable working under those circumstances.\u201d\n\nShe said that despite strong Ukrainian resistance, and Russia\u2019s failings, the war is not likely to end soon. \u201cYou are looking at quite a long game \u2026 certainly through this year and probably through next year\u201d, and effectively warned that Kyiv will not be safe until Russia has been defeated.\n\n\u201cPolitically, I don\u2019t doubt that Putin\u2019s objectives for Ukraine have not changed, even though their tanks had to withdraw back to the north from Kyiv,\u201d she said. \u201cI can also see that the Kyiv city administration and the Ukraine armed forces are not taking that gain for granted at all. And they\u2019re right.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the UK thought Ukraine should try to push the struggling Russian military out of the country altogether, and reclaim Crimea, she said the first military focus should be reclaiming territory seized since the invasion began.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing right now is to push Russia back to where they were before February \u2026 because that\u2019s where the existential threat lies. Let\u2019s get to that stage. And then let\u2019s see,\u201d she said.\n\nBut she added that the UK \u201chas never recognised the illegal annexation of Crimea\u201d, or the separatist claims on the Donbas region, and that those land grabs now have \u201can awful lot more profile than they did before the invasion. It\u2019s focused an awful lot more people\u2019s attention on it.

(Carolyn Cole/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images) Some evacuations have taken place at the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, where hundreds of people, including dozens injured during an intense Russian bombardment over the past several weeks, are thought to be trapped. Here are the latest developments: The Azovstal steel plant: Nearly every building at the sprawling steel plant, the last Ukrainian holdout in Mariupol, has been destroyed, new satellite images from Maxar Technologies show. Some civilians have been evacuated from the plant after a ceasefire was introduced, according to a Ukrainian commander inside. Russian submarine: Russia has released video showing it is using a submarine in the Black Sea to launch cruise missile attacks on Ukraine, confirming earlier Ukrainian military claims. Explosions in Odesa: Multiple explosions in the southern city of Odesa were reported soon after 6 p.m. local time by Ukrainian media and witnesses. One witness told CNN she saw at least one combat plane over the city. The runway at Odesa's airport had been damaged, according to the Ukrainian military. Russian tanks destroyed: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Ukrainian army has already destroyed more than 1,000 Russian tanks, nearly 200 Russian aircraft, and almost 2,500 armored fighting vehicles. Rebuilding and recovery: 69% of de-occupied settlements in Ukraine now have \u201cfull-fledged local self-government\u201d again, Zelensky said in his Saturday night address, adding the work of humanitarian offices has already begun in 93% of liberated settlements.\n\nUkrainian army has destroyed more than 1,000 Russian tanks, Zelensky says A destroyed Russian tank on a road in the Kyiv region on April 16. Genya Savilov/AFP/Getty Images Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Ukrainian army has already destroyed more than 1,000 Russian tanks, nearly 200 Russian aircraft, and almost 2,500 armored fighting vehicles. Despite these losses, Russian troops still have equipment to launch additional attacks, Zelensky said. Of course, the occupiers still have equipment in stock. Yes, they still have missiles to strike at our territory,\" he added. \"But this war has already weakened Russia so much that they have to plan (to have) even fewer military equipment for the parade in Moscow.\" On May 9, Russia plans to hold its traditional Victory Day parade in Red Square, commemorating the German surrender to the Soviet Union in the Second World War. The Ukrainian President also said Russia has already lost more than 23,000 soldiers since the invasion began. CNN cannot independently verify this claim. Russia has sporadically released casualty figures that are low and which observers deem to be a massive underestimate. Two days prior to Russia\u2019s update, two senior NATO military officials estimated the number of Russian soldiers killed in action in Ukraine to be between 7,000 and 15,000. Around the same time, other US officials had put Russian losses in a similar range -- between 7,000 and 14,000 Russian soldiers killed -- but they expressed \u201clow confidence\u201d in those estimates. Earlier in the month, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov briefly admitted Russia had suffered \u201csignificant\u201d losses of its troops in Ukraine, calling the losses \u201ca huge tragedy\u201d for the country in an interview with Sky News.\n\nAngelina Jolie speaks with refugees at boarding school and medical institution in Lviv Angelina Jolie with kids in Lviv, Ukraine, on April 30. Actress Angelina Jolie, who is also a United Nations special envoy for refugees, visited a boarding school and medical institution in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, according to Maksym Kozytskyy, the head of Lviv's regional military administration. \"In one of the medical institutions, she has visited children who suffered from a missile strike by the Russian military on the Kramatorsk train station. She was very moved by their stories. One girl was even able to tell Ms. Jolie about her dream privately,\" according to Kozytskyy. When visiting a boarding school in the region, \"she promised to come again,\" he said. \"She also took the time to talk to our volunteers who provide medical and psychological assistance at the Main Railway Station in Lviv. She thanked them for their work,\" he said. \"She talked to people who managed to leave the zones of active hostilities.\" \"This visit was a surprise for all of us,\" Kozytskyy added. UNHCR's Head of Global Communications Joung-ah Ghedini-Williams told CNN Saturday that \"Angelina Jolie is traveling to the region in her personal capacity and UNHCR has no involvement in this visit.\" Earlier on Saturday, Jolie was photographed visiting a coffee shop in Lviv. CNN has reached out to Jolie's representatives for comment.\n\nUkrainian commander inside Mariupol steel plant says evacuations of civilians have begun A satellite image shows an overview of the Azovstal steel plant, the last Ukrainian military holdout which is also serving as a civilian shelter in Mariupol, Ukraine, on April 29. (Maxar Technologies/Reuters) Some civilians have been evacuated from the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol after a ceasefire was introduced, according to a commander in the Azov Regiment, one of the Ukrainian soldiers trapped at the plant. Capt. Svyatoslav Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov Regiment, said the ceasefire, which was supposed to begin at 6 a.m. local time, ended up starting at 11 a.m. local time. \"As of now, it's the truth, both sides follow the ceasefire regime,\" he said. The evacuation convoy was very delayed, he said. \"Since 6 a.m., we've been waiting for the evacuation convoy to arrive, which only arrived at 6:25 p.m.\" \"We have brought 20 civilians to the agreed meeting point, whom we've managed to rescue from under the rubble. These are women and children. We hope these people will go the agreed destination, which is Zaporizhzhia, the territory controlled by Ukraine,\" Palamar said. \"As of now, the rescue operation is ongoing, conducted by the servicemen of Azov - we rescue the civilians from under the rubble,\" he added. \"These are women, children and the elderly,\" he said in a video message on the regiment's Telegram channel. \"We hope that this process will be further extended and we will successfully evacuate all civilians,\" he said. \"As for the wounded \u2014 those people who require urgent medical care \u2014 it is unclear to us why they are not being evacuated and their evacuation to the territory controlled by Ukraine is not being discussed,\" he added.\n\n\"I emphasize that we ask to guarantee the evacuation not just for civilians but also for our wounded servicemen who require medical care.\" TASS, Russia's state news agency, said earlier Saturday that a group of civilians left the steel plant. A correspondent on the scene told TASS that a total of 25 people came out, including six children under the age of 14. CNN cannot independently verify the TASS reporting. There are thought to be hundreds of people inside the steel complex, including dozens injured during an intense Russian bombardment over the past several weeks. The latest satellite images of the plant show that many of its buildings have been reduced to ruins. The defenders of the Azovstal plant said that attacks on Wednesday night had hit the makeshift hospital inside the complex, greatly adding to the number of injured. Here's what a part of the plant looked like approximately six weeks ago: A satellite image from March 22 shows an overview of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian media and witnesses reported multiple explosions in the southern city of Odesa soon after 6 p.m. local time. One witness told CNN that she saw at least one combat plane over the city. The military's Operational Command (South) said on Telegram that the runway at Odesa's airport had been damaged. The blasts were heard soon after air raid sirens sounded across the city. A witness to the explosions told CNN she was about one kilometer (.62 miles) away from the airport when she heard two explosions. She said the attack lasted about 10 minutes and she was still experiencing hearing difficulties because of the noise from the impacts.\n\nRussia steps up efforts to rub out Ukrainian identity as Lenin reappears in the southern part of the country A popular Ukrainian supermarket in the southern region of Zaporizhzhia announced a grand reopening Saturday under new \u2013 Russian \u2013 management. It is the latest sign of attempts by Moscow\u2019s occupying forces to rub out Ukrainian identity in territories under its control. Formerly, the shop in Melitopol was part of the ATB chain, a Dnipro-based business. But a leaflet posted on a local TV station\u2019s Telegram channel boasts the supermarket is now part of the MERA chain, which is headquartered in St. Petersburg, Russia. The leaflet promises that shoppers spending at least 500 hryvnia (about $16) will be entered into a \u201csuper prize draw\u201d \u2013 though details of what the winner could take home are not revealed. Elsewhere in the region, a large Ukrainian coat of arms has been removed from the front of the mayor\u2019s office in the town of Tokmak. Photos circulating on social media show the distinctive Ukrainian symbol \u2013 a yellow trident on a blue background \u2013 propped up against the entrance of the building. An earlier photo on the same Telegram channel shows a man up a ladder apparently working to loosen the trident from its place. And as if to underline the sense of a clock being turned back, video has emerged from the neighboring region of Kherson \u2014 also under Russian occupation \u2014 of a statue of former Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin being re-erected in the town of Nova Kakhovka. One video captures the statue of the Russian revolutionary and first leader of the Soviet Union being carried flat on a truck through the city. A later photo shows the statue being winched onto a plinth in front of the city council building. \u201cWhile Ukraine is the first in the world to introduce e-passports, \u2018orcs\u2019 are restoring Lenin's monument in temporarily occupied Nova Kakhovka,\u201d Mykhailo Fedorov, Deputy Prime Minister, said in a Telegram post under the photo, using the popular Ukrainian slang term for Russian forces. Some context: Statues of Vladimir Lenin were a hallmark of towns and cities across the Soviet Union, but many have been removed from Ukrainian locations in recent years as relations with Russia have deteriorated.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-04-30-22/h_e39c1edb3377b493b9464fbd96e3ca11",

Data from With Intelligence shows that hedge funds generally protected wealth during the first quarter. However, while they broadly outperformed stocks in January and February, hedge funds could not stand up to the March rally in the stock market.\n\nThe Eurekahedge Hedge Fund Index from With Intelligence returned 1.35% in March, underperforming the S&P 500's 3.58% return. The markets have been dealing with the broad sanctions on Russia imposed by the U.S. and its allies in connection with its invasion of Ukraine. Concerns about stagflation started to grow as the Federal Reserve shifted to a more hawkish stance as it tried to combat inflation.\n\nThe U.S. Consumer Price Index jumped 8.5% in March, marking the largest year-over-year increase since December 1981. The Fed hiked interest rates by 25 basis points in March, attempting to rein in inflation as at least six more rate hikes are expected this year.\n\nLatin America led all other geographies in March with a 3.59% return, while Asia, excluding Japan, brought up the rear with a loss of 1.4%. Among strategies, CTA/ managed futures funds posted the best performance at 4.59%, while arbitrage was the worst-performing strategy at -1.16%.\n\nPreliminary flows data suggests hedge funds racked up $19 billion in performance-driven gains in March, although $2.6 billion in outflows partially offset that. The global hedge fund industry had $2.4 trillion in assets under management as of the end of March.\n\nLooking at the first quarter as a whole, With Intelligence reports that hedge funds were roughly flat, protecting wealth as the stock market tumbled, as represented by the -4.9% return for large-cap U.S. stocks. The firm reports that hedge funds lost 1.3% in January and 0.3% in February but flipped into the green for March with a return of 1.4%.\n\nAlthough investors pulled money from hedge funds in March, With Intelligence reports that they added to their hedge funds overall during the first quarter, with inflows amounting to $11.2 billion in the first three months of the year.\n\nThe firm adds that $8.5 billion of those inflows went to macro funds, while $4.3 billion went into managed futures funds. According to Eurekahedge data, the hedge fund industry has recorded $10.8 billion in performance-based losses and $18.3 billion in investor redemptions for the first three months of the year.\n\nAs far as strategies, CTA/ managed futures funds are leading the way year to date with a return of 6.84%, followed by macro funds, which are up 2.52%.\n\nHowever, there is a discrepancy in the data as With Intelligence shows a return of 7.8% for managed futures funds in the first quarter. According to Eurekahedge, fixed income, arbitrage and long/ short equity funds are at the bottom of the heap on a year-to-date basis with returns of -1.89%, -2.68% and -3.58%, respectively.\n\nData from With Intelligence agrees with Eurekahedge on the top and bottom hedge fund strategies, with managed futures and macro funds at the top, the only two strategies with meaningfully positive returns.\n\nHowever, the return numbers were different even though Eurekahedge is owned by With Intelligence, demonstrating just how widely the data differs by firm. Different hedge funds report to different firms, so to get a more concrete picture of how hedge funds are doing, it helps to review data from multiple sources.\n\nAccording to With Intelligence, multi-strategy and event-driven funds were essentially flat for the first quarter, while relative value and arbitrage, fixed-income and credit, funds of funds, and long/ short equity funds were all in the red. Long/ short equity was the worst-performing strategy with a -3.5% return, while funds of funds were the second-worst strategy at -2.3%.\n\nConsequences of the war in Ukraine\n\nThe best return among hedge funds with at least $50 million in assets was 59.8% for the first quarter. The best-performing macro fund, the Haidar Jupiter Fund, returned 149% in the first quarter. Fifty-five percent of funds with more than $1 billion in assets have posted a positive return year to date.\n\nThe first quarter has been marked by continued, worsening inflation and significant geopolitical risks, both of which have impacted market performance. It was no surprise that managed futures, and macro hedge funds benefited the most from the volatility triggered by the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe economic and political consequences of the Russian invasion upset the market's bullish expectations for economic recovery and central bank policies. The firm added that those consequences also sent reversals and dislocations sweeping through the market.\n\nAccording to With Intelligence, the war in Ukraine will cause a secondary and collateral impact on national economies and companies for years to come.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.forbes.com/sites/annestevenson-yang/2021/09/25/chairman-xi-chinas-looming-crisis-and-the-myth-of-infallibility/", "https://www.valuewalk.com/investing-in-hedge-funds-is-it-worth-it/", "https://valuewalkpremium.com/these-hedge-funds-and-investors-are-struggling-under-russia-sanctions/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2021/09/27/meet-private-equitys-quiet-corporate-turnaround-artist/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2021/09/27/the-30-billion-kitty-meet-the-investor-who-made-a-fortune-on-pet-food/", "https://www.valuewalk.com/volatility-spikes-on-russian-aggression-in-ukraine/"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": "68cf2274f011412eb5374581dea91b72", "name": "Jacob Wolinsky"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "hedge funds", "weight": 0.11868876}, {"name": "macro hedge funds", "weight": 0.11620715}, {"name": "Different hedge funds", "weight": 0.112943254}, {"name": "macro funds", "weight": 0.107705906}, {"name": "managed futures funds", "weight": 0.10500462}, {"name": "funds", "weight": 0.104369834}, {"name": "CTA/ managed futures funds", "weight": 0.09838673}, {"name": "long/ short equity funds", "weight": 0.09561131}, {"name": "returns", "weight": 0.08926806}, {"name": "year", "weight": 0.08566764}], "topics": [], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "With Intelligence", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 9}, {"data": "the Federal Reserve", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Eurekahedge", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "the Haidar Jupiter Fund", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Russia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "U.S.", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Ukraine", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Japan", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Latin America", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Asia", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Russian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.14487621, "negative": 0.8266886, "neutral": 0.028435107}, "summary": "The firm adds that $8.5 billion of those inflows went to macro funds, while $4.3 billion went into managed futures funds. \n\nAs far as strategies, CTA/ managed futures funds are leading the way year to date with a return of 6.84%, followed by macro funds, which are up 2.52%.\n\nHowever, there is a discrepancy in the data as With Intelligence shows a return of 7.8% for managed futures funds in the first quarter. \n\nData from With Intelligence agrees with Eurekahedge on the top and bottom hedge fund strategies, with managed futures and macro funds at the top, the only two strategies with meaningfully positive returns.\n\nHowever, the return numbers were different even though Eurekahedge is owned by With Intelligence, demonstrating just how widely the data differs by firm.

The gold items were from the Scythian empire and dated back to the fourth century B.C.\n\nThen the mysterious expert, the Russian soldiers and the gold disappeared.\n\n\u201cThe orcs have taken hold of our Scythian gold,\u201d declared Melitopol\u2019s mayor, Ivan Fyodorov, using a derogatory term many Ukrainians reserve for Russian soldiers. \u201cThis is one of the largest and most expensive collections in Ukraine, and today we don\u2019t know where they took it.\u201d\n\nRussian soldiers commanded a caretaker at the museum to take them to the Scythian gold.\n\nThe caretaker refused, according to Leila Ibrahimova, Director of the Melitopol Museum of Local History. But the man in the white coat found the (hidden gold) anyway with the help of a Ukrainian, Evgeny Gorlachev, who was appointed by the Russian military as the museum\u2019s new director, she said. A Russian crew filmed part of the robbery.\n\nIn an interview on Russian television, Mr. Gorlachev said the gold artifacts \u201care of great cultural value for the entire former Soviet Union\u201d and that the previous administrators of the museum \u201cspent a lot of effort and energy\u201d to hide them.\n\n\u201cFor what purpose, no one knows,\u201d he said. \u201cBut thanks to these people and the operational work carried out, residents of the city of Melitopol \u2014 and not only Melitopol \u2014 will be able to observe again a large collection of Scythian gold.\u201d He did not say when or where the artifacts would be displayed.\n\nMs. Ibrahimova, who spoke by phone, sounded despondent as she spoke about the Russian invaders.\n\n\u201cMaybe culture is the enemy for them,\u201d she said. \u201cThey said that Ukraine has no state, no history. They just want to destroy our country. I hope they will not succeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Russians are making a war without rules,\u201d said Oleksandr Symonenko, a fellow of Ukraine\u2019s Archaeology Institute and a Scythian specialist. \u201cThis is not a war. It is destroying our life, our nature, our culture, our industry, everything. This a crime.\u201d\n\nThe caretaker who refused to help the Russians was released on Wednesday after the gold was stolen.
