A 50 basis points interest rate hike on Wednesday looks a done deal with the key issue being how hawkish will Powell be in the Q&A session.\n\nThat said, it doesn't seem there is much room to surprise on the hawkish side, analysts say, given that a total of 250 basis points is priced in by money markets by late 2023.\n\nTen-year Treasury yields nudged up first thing on Monday after clocking in April the largest gain since 2009, further extending its lead on S&P 500 dividend yields. The dollar also rose against a basket of currencies after scoring its best month since 2015 in April.\n\nStill in central banking, the BoE will follow on Thursday with a likely 25 basis-point rate hike, its fourth in a row.\n\nActivity on Monday could be thinner as London is shut for holiday along with other markets in Asia. Futures on the European indices fell more than 1%, although U.S. derivatives pointed to bounce back in the Nasdaq from 13-month lows.\n\nMeantime, concerns about weak economic growth in COVID-19 hit China lingered, sending oil prices down 1% and offsetting risks of supply stress from a potential EU ban on Russian crude.\n\nKey developments that should provide more direction to markets on Monday:\n\n- HSBC's largest shareholder has called for a break-up of the London-based bank, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. read more\n\n- Japan's manufacturing activity grew at a slower pace from the previous month in April as supply chain disruptions and strict Chinese coronavirus lockdown measures hurt overseas demand. read more\n\n- The EU is leaning toward a ban on imports of Russian oil by the end of the year, two EU diplomats said, after talks between the European Commission and EU member states this weekend. read more\n\n- Activity in China's services sector shrunk for the second straight month, an official survey showed on Saturday, as widespread COVID-19 lockdowns paralyze many cities. read more\n\n- German retail sales fell unexpectedly in March as the war in Ukraine leads to price increases read more", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/hsbcs-top-shareholder-calls-banking-giants-break-up-reports-2022-04-29/", "https://www.reuters.com/companies/AMZN.O", "https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japans-april-factory-activity-expands-slower-rate-pmi-2022-05-02/", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-april-service-sector-activity-contracts-second-month-official-pmi-2022-04-30/", "https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-leans-towards-russian-oil-ban-by-year-end-diplomats-say-2022-05-01/", "https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/german-retail-sales-unexpectedly-fall-march-2022-05-02/"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "first quarter U.S. GDP", "weight": 0.0686202}, {"name": "widespread COVID-19 lockdowns", "weight": 0.06701035}, {"name": "strict Chinese coronavirus lockdown measures", "weight": 0.0659001}, {"name": "slowing global growth", "weight": 0.06396966}, {"name": "April", "weight": 0.06384673}, {"name": "EU member states", "weight": 0.061733946}, {"name": "overseas demand", "weight": 0.06082016}, {"name": "other markets", "weight": 0.060726173}, {"name": "supply chain disruptions", "weight": 0.059033383}, {"name": "money markets", "weight": 0.05883597}], "topics": [], "categories": [{"name": "Business"}], "entities": [{"data": "Fuyang", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Anhui province", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "China", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "U.S.", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "London", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Japan", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ukraine", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "China Daily", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "REUTERS", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Amazon", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "AMZN.O", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Federal Reserve", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Treasury", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "BoE", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Nasdaq", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "HSBC", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the European Commission", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Danilo Masoni", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Powell", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Europe", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Asia", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "this morning", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "European", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Russian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Chinese", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "German", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.061766706, "negative": 0.92487794, "neutral": 0.013355358}, "summary": "\n\nA sharply lower close on Wall Street on Friday will set the tone across Europe this morning, as a busy week for central banks kicks off the new month following a stormy April dominated by concerns about slowing global growth. \n\nDisappointing numbers from Amazon (AMZN.O) sent shares of the e-commerce giant into their worst day since 2006, adding fuel to worries that the world's largest economy is slowing -- just a day after a surprise decline in first quarter U.S. GDP. -

At the same time, governments must continue to focus on reducing environmental damage \u2013 in particular, on cutting greenhouse-gas emissions. Both goals, geopolitical and environmental, are urgent and should be evaluated together.\n\nThese two objectives are not necessarily in conflict, as some believe. There are plenty of energy measures the west can adopt that would benefit the environment and further its geopolitical aims. The most obvious steps, especially for the European Union, are sanctions that reduce demand for imports of fossil fuels from Russia.\n\nA review of different areas of energy policy reveals further options. Here, I emphasise the dos and don\u2019ts that seem to be clear win-win choices, as opposed to policy decisions where tradeoffs are acute and reasonable observers may disagree.\n\nThe first policy choice is a blunt one: governments should not prolong the life of coal and should withdraw coal subsidies. The International Monetary Fund has estimated that global energy subsidies (including for oil and natural gas, as well as coal), at either the producer or consumer end, exceed $5tn a year. Direct US fossil-fuel subsidies alone have been conservatively estimated at $20bn annually.\n\nNext, policymakers should regulate natural gas. Continental Europe has made itself dependent on Russian gas, and US shipments of liquefied natural gas can help substitute for it. But if there is to be a renewal of the fracking boom, which actually reduced total US carbon dioxide emissions from 2007 to 2012, careful regulation should drastically reduce the amount of methane released into the atmosphere as part of the process. Fortunately, this regulation need not be expensive.\n\nNot subsidising oil also is key. Global petroleum subsidies amount to an estimated $1.5th a year. If the US must open more federal lands to drilling, it should no longer offer leases to drillers at below-market rates.\n\nWestern governments should also tap existing stockpiles, as Joe Biden did recently by announcing an unprecedented release of 180m barrels of oil from the country\u2019s Strategic Petroleum Reserve. While presidents have in the past sometimes used the reserve for political purposes, Biden\u2019s decision has a genuine national-security justification, because the release can help to offset some of the current temporary supply shortfall.\n\nSome argue that the oil reserve is not big enough to put a dent in global prices. But the US move has been accompanied by releases of similar emergency reserves by the UK, Germany, and many other countries, totaling 240m barrels over the next six months. Some economists also argue that the US does not need an oil reserve, now that the country is no longer a net importer of oil. Even if one agrees, this would not be an argument against releasing reserves now, but rather against restocking the reserve when the crisis has passed.\n\nIn addition, governments should raise, not lower, taxes on retail petroleum products. Several US states have recently declared \u201cgas tax holidays\u201d to cushion consumers from the effects of high global oil prices. Other countries also are trying to shield their citizens from energy-price increases. But these measures, while understandable politically, are terrible economics: They undermine drivers\u2019 incentive to economise on their fuel consumption, thus benefiting Russia and hurting the environment.\n\nAs they stop promoting coal and oil, governments must keep up the momentum behind renewables. Continuing the recent trend toward wind and solar power is important for both geopolitical and environmental reasons. Government subsidies for renewables, including to support research into storage technology, can play a role. But the US and the EU should also take the less popular step of lowering, not raising, their tariffs and other protectionist barriers affecting imports of solar panels and wind turbines \u2013 imports that have helped bring down renewable-energy costs.\n\nAt the same time, governments need to steel themselves to extend the life of nuclear power plants. One of the most misguided current energy policies is Germany\u2019s surprising choice to proceed with plans to close its three remaining nuclear plants later this year, rather than trying to reopen the three that it closed in December. The country\u2019s decision in 2011, in response to the Fukushima disaster, to shut down all of its nuclear power over the course of the subsequent decade has led to increased dependence on coal and Russian fossil-fuel imports, and to higher CO emissions.\n\nOther countries assess the pros and cons of nuclear power differently. Fewer deaths resulted from the Japanese nuclear accident than occur every day from mining or burning coal. The UK now plans to build eight new nuclear reactors this decade, partly to reduce its dependence on oil imports in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe best way to reduce demand for fossil fuels is through a carbon tax or auctions of tradeable permits (with the revenue used to reduce distortionary taxes, for example). For now, introducing such price mechanisms in the US is politically impossible. But, 20 years ago, we said the same about the EU, and today it has the Emissions Trading System.\n\nCutting demand for hydrocarbons hurts the earnings of all oil exporters, not just Russia. But while some of these producers are innocent bystanders, some are petrostates that are not entirely worthy of support from the US and its allies. It is not coincidental that so many oil-exporting countries are autocracies. Many studies of the natural-resource curse have concluded that societies built on the wealth of commodities in general, and oil in particular, are prone to authoritarianism.\n\nIn the long run, it might be better all around if the fossil-fuel sector were to shrink worldwide. As western governments seek to devise energy policies that are both environmentally and geopolitically robust, that thought should help to concentrate minds.\n\nJeffrey Frankel is a professor at Harvard University\u2019s John F Kennedy School of Government.

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe long-delayed survey, now wrapped in the equivalent of caution tape, opens at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. It\u2019s been a learning-curve climb for four venues.\n\nBOSTON \u2014 On Oct. 16, 1970, the American painter Philip Guston, who is the subject of a potent and controversial retrospective at the Museum of Fine Arts here, committed career suicide. Or so it seemed. In his late 50s, he was a star of the Abstract Expressionist movement, then still considered the mandarin market style. But that year, he filled a New York gallery not with his signature flickery, emberlike abstractions, but with paintings of goony, cartoonish figures wearing white Ku Klux Klan hoods. Instantly he plummeted from art world grace. Guston had touched a nerve, though not what might have seemed the obvious one. The Klan images themselves weren\u2019t the primary source of offense; his betrayal of \u201chigh\u201d art was. At a point when the pre-eminence of abstraction was steadily being submerged under the plastic tide of Pop, Guston had joined the polluters. As it has turned out, the work that got him canceled in 1970 ended up cementing his place in the art historical pantheon, where it continues to inspire generations of artists with its critique of racism, anti-Semitism and bigotry. And recently the same work \u2014 specifically the paintings of Klansmen \u2014 has been the source of another, different controversy, one that has brought anathema down on the art establishment itself.\n\nThe National Gallery, its first stop, was careful to say that the decision to postpone in no way reflected lack of faith in the artist, but a concern about the reception of his work in a politically combustive time. But, for good historical reason, our big, conservative museums have little to no political credibility. Critics, artists and curators pounced, crying censorship and demanding the survey proceed as planned. Caught between fight or flight, the National Gallery reduced the delay to two years, and the itinerary was revised, making Boston the initial venue, where the show \u2014 now wrapped in the equivalent of caution tape \u2014 opens on Sunday. Actually, it\u2019s a logical starting place. M.F.A. Boston has become acutely alert to matters of audience inclusion and sensitivity since 2019, when a visiting group of Black middle school students claimed that they had been mistreated by staff, and the allegations became national news. An apology from the museum\u2019s leadership followed, along with a promise to \u201cmake sure that everyone feels welcome here.\u201d For sure the museum has taken pains in its Guston installation to head off upset. A handout statement by a trauma specialist warns of disturbing content ahead. A detour out of and back into the galleries allows visitors to skirt potentially triggering material. Archival photographs of Nazi concentration camps and Ku Klux Klan meetings \u2014 of a sort openly displayed in many history museums \u2014 are here hidden away in slide-top vitrines. If such cautionary features represented the sum total of a promised \u201crethinking,\u201d the postponement would be a bust.\n\nWorking with a total of 100 paintings and drawings \u2014 Boston\u2019s will be the smallest edition of the show \u2014 they have downplayed the chronological sequencing favored by the catalog, though you can still piece together a narrative from timelines placed high on the wall in each gallery. The artist was born Phillip Goldstein in 1913 in Montreal, Canada, where his parents had come as refugees fleeing anti-Jewish pogroms in Ukraine. He grew up in Los Angeles. There he picked up art early \u2014 Jackson Pollock was a high school friend \u2014 and aligned himself with leftist politics, an involvement that led to brushes with militant right-wing groups, including the Klan. He began as a figurative painter in the 1930s and \u201940s, influenced by Mexican muralism, Picasso, Italian Renaissance fresco painting and comic strips (\u201cKrazy Kat,\u201d \u201cMutt and Jeff\u201d and much later R. Crumb\u2019s countercultural Zap Comix). Constitutionally restless, he shopped through styles, and in the 1950s shifted to gestural abstraction, then the vanguard mode. By then known as Philip Guston, he became a fixture in Abstract Expressionist circles in New York, living both in the city and upstate in Woodstock. In the late 1960s, with Nixon in the White House, Americans napalming Vietnam, and racial violence in the streets, he returned to figure painting, retaining his brushy Ab-Ex moves but applying them to a lexicon of images \u2014 Klan figures, detached bug-eyed heads, severed legs and piled-up shoes seen in Holocaust photographs \u2014 which he reused and combined until his death in 1980 at 66.\n\nThe show\u2019s opening gallery, emblazoned with the phrase \u201cWhat Kind of Man Am I?\u201d \u2014 a quote from Guston \u2014 makes the point with a display of what the curators interpret as self-images from across his life. One, dated 1944 and actually titled \u201cSelf-Portrait,\u201d is a realistic likeness, soulful almost to the point of being a sendup of romantic melancholy. In \u201cHead I\u201d (1965), a mask-like tangle of dark paint floats against a light ground, under which traces of another form \u2014 a triangular shape (a Klan hood?) \u2014 can be detected. And in \u201cUntitled,\u201d a small, square painting done the year Guston died, a gray battered stone with one staring eye contemplates the Sisyphean task of rolling itself up an incline. Much of the rest of the show expands on the idea of locating Guston\u2019s questioning, questing presence in his art. All strange stuff. If you wanted to make Guston look semi-normal \u2014 conventionally, classically Modern \u2014 you would foreground his 1950s abstractions and hang them together, a wall of gestural elegance. The Boston show does the opposite. It includes just a few abstract paintings and mixes them in with everything else, making them parts of a great wildness.\n\nHe made art that is rich in its worldly references, yet resistant to readability; art that is ethically charged, but also ethically unfixed. This helps explain why he remains a liberating example for many contemporary artists. (Several, including Glenn Ligon, Trenton Doyle Hancock, Dana Schutz and Art Spiegelman, contribute to the catalog.) It may also explain why, in 2020, the four museums that organized his retrospective felt that they needed more time to figure him out. Was postponing the Guston retrospective wrong? I was OK with it, and unsurprised. Big old museums, the most change-aversive of institutions, are way behind the times and are being prodded hard to move forward these days. The pandemic picked their pockets; the racial justice movement, and their fumbling response to it, left them shamed and perplexed. But they seem to be waking up to the fact that, to keep afloat in a demographically shifting world, they need to court new audiences and that the new audiences may be different from older ones. They may want to find their own stories in museums, along with corrected histories. They may encounter a Guston Klan painting and, before seeing \u201cart,\u201d see an emblem of racist hate made by a white man, which is, of course, what the Guston painting is, redeemed only by the fact that Guston knew it.\n\nSo, given the nature of the institutions involved, and the learning curve climb some of them appear to have signed on for, I was fine with them putting in extra time on Guston. Judging by the results in Boston, the M.F.A. spent the time well. Sure, the therapeutic hand-holding business could go, but the exhibition itself is absorbing every step of the way. It brings Guston himself to life, thrashingly, ferociously so. And the art is great. You see the 1969 picture called \u201cThe Studio,\u201d in which a Klansmen paints his own portrait (Guston called the piece a self-portrait), or the monumental \u201cPainting Smoking, Eating,\u201d from 1973, with its Cyclopean figure (another self-portrait?) lying in bed, a plate of food on his chest, a cigarette stuck in his mouth, and the stack of shoes beside him, lifted from concentration camp photos, and you think \u201cFantastic!\u201d Walking through the show you think it again and again, and that\u2019s what art should make you do.

If the measure becomes law, experts expect Putin to be unhappy at the prospect of losing so much talent.\n\nBackground: After Russia invaded Ukraine, tens of thousands of Russian scientists and engineers left the country. Many sought temporary respites in other countries, such as Georgia, while weighing their options. Those unable to find a permanent place to live and work are likely to return to Russia.\n\n\u201cIn a sign that Russia fears a brain drain as a result of the war, the government last month [in March 2022] exempted young workers in the technology sector from compulsory military service, offering them advantageous mortgage rates, and freeing IT [information technology] companies from income tax and inspections, as well as granting them access to cheap loans,\u201d according to the Financial Times.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Catherine Rampell advocated America open its doors to Russian scientists and engineers to \u201cDrain Putin\u2019s Brains.\u201d A February 2022 Forbes article discussed why the United States should welcome Russian students and professionals with technical expertise.\n\nWhat Does the Immigration Measure Do? In a letter to the House on April 28, 2022, the Biden administration included a measure on Russian scientists and engineers as part of requested legislation for the FY 2022 emergency supplemental funding for Ukraine. \u201cThis authority would help the United States attract and retain Russian STEM [science, technology, engineering and math] talent and undercut Russia's innovative potential, benefiting U.S. national security,\u201d according to the administration\u2019s description of the provision.\n\nThe measure would eliminate the need for Russians with a master\u2019s or doctoral degree in a STEM field to obtain an employer sponsor or be placed in backlogs for permanent residence (green cards). It would require adjudication within 90 days if possible, taking into account the need for security assessments. The measure would end after four years (unless Congress later extended it).\n\nAs a technical matter, the proposed legislation is necessary to attract Russian scientists and engineers because H-1B status would be impossible for them to obtain except at an employer exempt from the numerical limit (such as a university), while other parts of the U.S. immigration system are unlikely to be available for them. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced in April it received nearly 400,000 more H-1B registrations than available H-1B petitions for FY 2023.\n\nHere is the legislative text of the provision:\n\n\u201cIN GENERAL.\u2014 Section 203(b)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(2)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n\u201c(D) Notwithstanding subparagraph (B), the requirements of subparagraph (A) that an alien\u2019s services in the sciences, arts, professions, or business be sought by an employer in the United States shall not apply to aliens (and the parents, spouses, and children of such aliens if accompanying or following to join) who\u2014\n\n\u201c(ii) have earned a masters or doctoral degree in the United States or an equivalent foreign degree in a field involving science, technology, engineering, or mathematics, including but not limited to degrees relevant to the following fields: Advanced Computing, Advanced Engineering Materials, Advanced Gas Turbine Engine Technologies, Advanced Manufacturing, Advanced and Networked Sensing and Signature Management, Advanced Nuclear Energy Technologies, Advanced Particle Detector Instrumentation Technologies, Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Systems and Robotics, Biotechnologies, Communication and Networking Technologies, Cybersecurity, Directed Energy, Financial Technologies, Human-Machine Interfaces, Hypersonics, Advanced Missile Propulsion Technologies, Networked Sensors and Sensing, Quantum Information Technologies, Renewable Energy Generation and Storage, Semiconductors and Microelectronics, Space Technologies and Systems; and \u201c(iii) are seeking admission to engage in work in the United States in an endeavor related to science, technology, engineering, or mathematics.\u201d.\n\n\u201c(b) ADJUDICATION AND VETTING.\u2014Petitions and applications submitted under this section should be adjudicated expeditiously, as appropriate, within 90 days upon submission of all required documents, and should receive a timely adjudication, as appropriate, including any necessary steps to complete a security or fraud assessment of the applicant.\n\n\u201c(c) NUMERICAL LIMITATIONS.\u2014Section 201(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1151(b)(1)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n\u201c(F) Immigrants described in subparagraph (D) of section 203(b)(2).\u201d.\n\n\u201c(d) TERMINATION.\u2014The authority of subsection (a) shall terminate 4 years after the date of enactment of this Act.\u201d\n\nWhat Will Vladimir Putin Think?: Gleb Yushin, an engineering and materials professor at Georgia Tech who graduated with a B.A. in physics from the Polytechnic Institute in Saint Petersburg, Russia, applauded the U.S. initiative to offer a streamlined path to permanent residence for Russian scientists and engineers. \u201cI think it is an outstanding strategic move to benefit the United States and weaken Putin\u2019s authoritarian regime,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe smartest and most creative scientists and engineers cannot prosper in a country that severely restricts their freedom and values natural resources more than people\u2019s abilities to innovate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be challenging for Putin to counter this measure because restricting exit would ruin his support and reputation,\u201d said Yushin, who cofounded Sila Nanotechnologies, a U.S. company valued today at more than $3 billion. \u201cIssuing exit visas [as in the days of the Soviet Union] would make everyone want to leave even more. The reality is many talented and hardworking people are eager to immigrate, but they feel nobody would welcome them, particularly now. Scientists and engineers want to maximize their positive impact, and they know they have a much better chance of achieving that from abroad.\u201d\n\nBrian D. Taylor, a professor of political science at Syracuse University, agrees with Yushin. \u201cSome experts have estimated that hundreds of thousands of Russians have already left, including tens of thousands in the IT sector,\u201d said Taylor in an interview. \u201cIf Russians with the right educational backgrounds will be able to emigrate to the U.S. without even finding an employment sponsor, that will look like an attractive option to many.\u201d\n\nHe believes the situation would become even more precarious inside Russia should Vladimir Putin declare a general military mobilization for the populace. Taylor noted in an earlier interview that sanctions and the departure of large Western firms would limit economic opportunities for many Russians.\n\nIn his book The Code of Putinism, Taylor explained that in Russia, only about 27% of employed persons work in small and medium-sized businesses, compared to 60% to 80% of the workforce in the world\u2019s 34 largest market economies. The reason? Corruption and a flawed legal system. He blames \u201craiding\u201d in Russia, where \u201claw enforcement instigates a trumped-up criminal case against a businessperson to deprive her of all or part of her business.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s immigration measure could be a strategic benefit and counter a key Russian claim\u2014the idea that the whole world is against \u201cRussians\u201d rather than aligned against Vladimir Putin and the Russian government for its actions in Ukraine. \u201cA significant portion of Russian propaganda channels portray Russian citizens as being treated unfairly in other countries,\u201d said Gleb Yushin. \u201cWelcoming Russian scientists and engineers would show exactly the opposite.\u201d", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/03/24/welcome-russian-talent-skilled-workers-to-relocate-here/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2021/09/22/immigrants-hope-registry-saves-immigration-bill/", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FY_2022_Emergency_Supplemental_Assistance-to-Ukraine_4.28.2022.pdf", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2022/02/27/critics-reject-rep-swalwells-idea-to-expel-all-russian-students/?sh=208428f86527", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelperegrine/2021/09/15/preparing-to-go-public-an-overview-of-the-ipo-process/", "https://www.amazon.com/Code-Putinism-Brian-D-Taylor-ebook-dp-B07D3RTYBG/dp/B07D3RTYBG/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2021/09/27/5-cognitive-biases-blocking-your-success/", "https://www.ft.com/content/8c576a9c-ba65-4fb1-967a-fc4fa5457c62", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2022/03/14/the-end-of-globalization-for-russia-and-russians-what-it-means/?sh=4e0d61fd3b67", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2022/04/18/the-h-1b-visa-lottery-and-americas-bad-immigration-law/?sh=6b7525ca125f"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": "97d32292cb31452ba496bd31cf08bb1c", "name": "Stuart Anderson"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Russian scientists", "weight": 0.08028739}, {"name": "Advanced Nuclear Energy Technologies", "weight": 0.07077639}, {"name": "Russian", "weight": 0.06856347}, {"name": "Russian students", "weight": 0.067697875}, {"name": "Advanced Missile Propulsion Technologies", "weight": 0.067394055}, {"name": "Russian citizens", "weight": 0.06729536}, {"name": "Advanced Gas Turbine Engine Technologies", "weight": 0.064627394}, {"name": "Advanced Particle Detector Instrumentation Technologies", "weight": 0.06438973}, {"name": "Russian propaganda channels", "weight": 0.06291277}, {"name": "Financial Technologies", "weight": 0.06025056}], "topics": [{"name": "Immigration"}, {"name": "Social Issues"}, {"name": "Russia"}, {"name": "Vladimir Putin"}, {"name": "Russia-Ukraine War"}], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "Russian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 19}, {"data": "Vladimir Putin\u2019s", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 8}, {"data": "Biden", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Catherine Rampell", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Gleb Yushin", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Brian D.

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAdvisers are taking a discreet approach to negotiating the Phoenix Mercury center\u2019s release from Russian detention, putting her anguished teammates and the league in a discomfiting position.\n\nPHOENIX \u2014 When will Brittney Griner be set free? That painful question hangs over the Phoenix Mercury, just as it is likely to hang over the coming W.N.B.A. season. Last week, at a home preseason game pitting Phoenix against the Seattle Storm, hip-hop blared and gyrating dance squads revved up the crowd. When the teams took the court, the public-address system crackled with the names of some of the most well-known players in women\u2019s basketball. Sue Bird. Breanna Stewart. Tina Charles. They were joined by the Mercury\u2019s 39-year-old virtuoso, Diana Taurasi, who was in street clothes for the preseason game but who plans to be ready when the regular season begins Friday. Griner, the Mercury\u2019s seven-time All-Star center, will not. Since February, she has been in Russian custody after customs officials at a Moscow area airport said they found vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage. Her glaring absence struck an awkward note. On the mammoth screen looming over the court in Phoenix, Griner\u2019s image flashed alongside her teammates\u2019 in promotional videos. Dozens of fans in the crowd wore Mercury jerseys emblazoned with her name and number, 42.\n\nThis was the first time the Mercury had played since Griner was taken into Russian custody, yet there was no official acknowledgment of her absence by the players, no moment of silence to reckon with the collective anguish for one of the league\u2019s most beloved performers, who is known to teammates and fans as B.G.\n\nThe silence is by design. The W.N.B.A. is perhaps the most progressive and outspoken American sports league. Its players have long taken public stands on issues such as race, gender equality, politics and reproductive rights. In the days after a Minneapolis police officer murdered George Floyd, W.N.B.A. players boycotted games. During the early, cloistered days of the pandemic, they wore black shirts that said, \u201cSay Her Name,\u201d referring to Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman shot and killed by the police in Louisville, Ky. But with Griner detained in Russia, her whereabouts and specific details on how she is faring relayed only to an inner circle of friends, family and advisers, the league is taking a stealthier approach. Instead of raising a ruckus, the players are quiet. Instead of clamoring for change, they keep their mouths shut.\n\nThey are following the lead of Griner\u2019s advisers, who have determined it best to let behind-the-scenes diplomacy work. With Griner facing up to 10 years in prison, they have reasoned the wisest move is to keep a low profile right now. At the moment, it makes sense, the reasoning goes, not to give President Vladimir V. Putin leverage in using Griner as a bargaining chip in negotiations while his military wages war against Ukraine. \u201cWe are absolutely outspoken about everything that we can possibly be,\u201d Mercury guard Kia Nurse, who is entering her fifth year in the W.N.B.A., said at the team\u2019s training facility last week. \u201cBut we are also very good at admitting that we don\u2019t know everything, and we are not the experts on every topic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re following the process,\u201d Nurse said, before noting the week\u2019s hopeful news. On Wednesday, the State Department announced that a former U.S. Marine, Trevor R. Reed, had gained his freedom in a prisoner swap after nearly three years of Russian detention. Among the Mercury players, Reed\u2019s return delivered a fresh dose of optimism that Griner could be next. But the deal for Reed also sparked renewed calls from activists outside her camp who wonder aloud whether enough is being done to bring Griner home. Why, they ask, wasn\u2019t she included in the swap? Why is everyone in the league remaining so circumspect? Wouldn\u2019t loud and visible protests for Griner help pressure some action? In Phoenix, more than a few fans told me they didn\u2019t feel Griner\u2019s case was getting enough attention. Or that if an N.B.A. star were in Russian custody \u2014 waiting for a hearing, as Griner is, and facing a possible lengthy prison sentence, as Griner is \u2014 the calls for his release would be thunderous, insistent and nonstop.\n\nWhat if Devin Booker was in Russian custody, she wondered, referencing the high-scoring guard for the Phoenix Suns? \u201cIf this was Booker, and not a gay, 6-foot-9-inch Black female? If this was someone from men\u2019s sports, I think they would have had something in his honor, even if it was a moment of silence.\u201d Johnson seemed as emotional about Griner as the player\u2019s teammates, who looked stricken with sadness every time I brought up Griner\u2019s name. Still, the Mercury players stuck to the script. They spoke of how much they love B.G. How special she is. How she is like a member of their family, and constantly in their thoughts and prayers. Behind careful words was raw pain. \u201cThat\u2019s my sister, so I love her,\u201d said Skylar Diggins-Smith, who won gold alongside Griner at last summer\u2019s Olympics in Tokyo. Diggins-Smith\u2019s straightforward words were weighted as her voice quaked with frustration and anguish shone in her eyes. She continued: \u201cI think about her every day, and I can\u2019t wait till she gets back here with us.\u201d\n\nBut fans like Johnson and her girlfriend, Autumn Gardner, want boldness from the league that has come to be known for it. As the preseason game against the Storm wound toward its conclusion, a 4-point Mercury loss, Gardner did not just say Griner\u2019s name. She yelled it. \u201cB.G.!\u201d she chanted, loud and insistent enough to reach down to the court. \u201cB.G.! B.G.!

He was in the recovery ward two days later when he was woken up by the sounds of war. \u201c I thought it was a fire alarm,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a double shock to learn what had happened from a nurse. Not only had Russia invaded my country, but I could barely move after my operation and we needed to get to the bomb shelter.\u201d\n\nSerhiy was among 450 patients who were receiving treatment at the National Cancer Institute in Kyiv when Russia invaded on 24 February; 40 of them were children recovering after surgery, chemotherapy or bone marrow transplants.\n\nLife changed irrevocably for everyone in Ukraine that day, but the institute\u2019s oncologists knew they still had a job to do. They were soon having to operate not only as the leading centre in the country for patients in need of lifesaving cancer treatment, but a refuge from the Russian army\u2019s murderous path. For those like Serhiy who were unable to return to their own homes or cities \u2013 Mariupol, Kherson and towns near Kyiv were either under bombardment or occupation \u2013 the institute was the only place where they could stay.\n\nSerhiy and his wife stayed at the Institute until 20 April before heading to western Ukraine to continue his cancer treatment. \u201cI\u2019m not alone in this situation,\u201d he said by phone . \u201cThere are thousands of cancer patients from Mariupol and other cities now occupied by Russia who have been left homeless, without work, without money, and on top of all that, we still need to continue our treatment.\u201d\n\nFounded in 1920, the National Cancer Institute is one of the oldest and most respected medical institutions in Ukraine. The exterior of its main buildings, which date back to the 1960s and 70s, is adorned by a huge Soviet-era mosaic.\n\nPrior to the invasion, doctors here who had access to operating rooms unparalleled in Ukraine, annually treated more than 25,000 cancer patients and performed 8,000 surgeries.\n\n\u201cThe first days of the invasion brought uncertainty and a sudden halt to the usual way we did things,\u201d says Andriy Beznosenko, the institute\u2019s lead doctor and a colorectal cancers specialist. \u201cA quarter of our employees could not get to work or were caught up with moving their families to the west of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nSeveral doctors were also conscripted or volunteered to go to fight on the frontlines. Makeshift beds quickly filled up the corridors located deep within the building to protect patients from missile strikes. With space running out, admitting new patients became difficult.\n\nBy week two, says Beznosenko, doctors and patients had started to adapt. Where possible, children were evacuated to Poland and adult patients from the east were moved to medical facilities in the west of the country.\n\nBut nearly two months into the war, 85% of staff have resumed work in Kyiv. Many have even moved into the Institute\u2019s premises themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s actually been very convenient,\u201d says Beznosenko. \u201cYou practice medicine, hold online conferences with doctors from other countries, analyse the professional situation in oncology and, as a result, you\u2019re less distracted, nervous, or in a hurry.\u201d\n\nVolunteers at the Institute also set up a 24/7 hotline that offers psychological help to cancer patients faced with the added trauma of dealing with serious medical issues during wartime. Only radiation therapy has not fully resumed operations.\n\nCountless Ukrainian cancer patients have, along with the 5 million people who have fled the country, ended up in Poland, Germany, the Baltic states and elsewhere seeking treatment. However many fled without first being able to obtain their medical records. Despite the circumstances, the institute has been able to supply digitised copies of records for many, and sometimes even provide consultations remotely. Beznosenko estimates that between 15% and 20% of Ukrainian cancer patients have had to discontinue their treatment as a result of the Russian invasion.\n\nMedics from the Ukrainian diaspora worldwide, meanwhile, are organising for materials to be sent to the institute. More than 2,000 bottles of Keitrude, one of the most expensive cancer drugs in the world \u2013 a single dose costs more than $5,000 (\u00a34,000) to administer \u2013 was recently obtained free of charge via a donation.\n\nBut the Kyiv clinicians say they are committed to more than diagnosing and treating cancer. They have been reaching out to the top US cancer centres asking them to take in and train Ukrainian oncologists who have fled the war, most of whom are women, since most men are not allowed to leave the country. The bureaucracy of the American medical and legal systems have made this a major challenge, but Beznosenko says they remain determined.\n\nHis team is also documenting their experiences and the lessons they have learned about wartime cancer treatment for the future research benefit of the international medical community. \u201cWe have an obligation to do so,\u201d he says. \u201cLet it be that none of them ever need it, but it is better that they are at least aware of what we\u2019ve managed to do. We didn\u2019t have access to the lessons learned by doctors in Syria or Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nThe situation remains dire for cancer patients in eastern Ukraine. Two oncology centres, one in Kharkiv and one Mariupol, were completely destroyed by Russian missile strikes and had to cease operations, according to Beznosenko. Nor is the Russian army providing humanitarian corridors from occupied areas to cancer patients who need treatment, he said. Oncology units in Chernihiv, Sumy, and Mykolaiv have repeatedly been hit by missile strikes yet they are continuing to take in patients.\n\nEven in peacetime, oncologists engage in a daily fight with a ruthless and unpredictable disease. In this sense, these doctors were already battle-hardened. With help from the global medical community, they feel prepared for a long haul. Ukrainians, Beznosenko said, \u201cwill remember the help we received during this terrible time for centuries to come\u201d.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine", "https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "cancer patients", "weight": 0.10898501}, {"name": "Ukrainian cancer patients", "weight": 0.1052478}, {"name": "Countless Ukrainian cancer patients", "weight": 0.098852634}, {"name": "lifesaving cancer treatment", "weight": 0.0978398}, {"name": "wartime cancer treatment", "weight": 0.09683087}, {"name": "cancer", "weight": 0.0853885}, {"name": "lung cancer", "weight": 0.08408202}, {"name": "patients", "weight": 0.07791824}, {"name": "adult patients", "weight": 0.07641434}, {"name": "new patients", "weight": 0.07566599}], "topics": [{"name": "Russia-Ukraine War"}], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "Serhiy", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Andriy Beznosenko", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 7}, {"data": "Mariupol", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Russia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Kyiv", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Ukraine", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "Kherson", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Poland", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Germany", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Syria", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Afghanistan", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Kharkiv", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Chernihiv", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Sumy", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Mykolaiv", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the National Cancer Institute", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Russian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Soviet", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ukrainian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Baltic", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "American", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Keitrude", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.031164953, "negative": 0.39587262, "neutral": 0.5729624}, "summary": "They were soon having to operate not only as the leading centre in the country for patients in need of lifesaving cancer treatment, but a refuge from the Russian army\u2019s murderous path. \u201cThere are thousands of cancer patients from Mariupol and other cities now occupied by Russia who have been left homeless, without work, without money, and on top of all that, we still need to continue our treatment.\u201d\n\n Volunteers at the Institute also set up a 24/7 hotline that offers psychological help to cancer patients faced with the added trauma of dealing with serious medical issues during wartime.

REUTERS/Yuya Shino/Files\n\nTOKYO, May 2 (Reuters) - Ryu Ishihara will soon be raising prices on his inexpensive bowls of soba noodles for the first time in nearly a decade, as rising costs and Russia's invasion of Ukraine take an unlikely toll on Japan's beloved buckwheat noodles.\n\nThough seen as one of the most quintessential of Japanese foods - and eaten on New Year's Eve for good luck - a good part of the buckwheat that goes into the noodles comes from Russia, globally the top buckwheat producer.\n\nRussian buckwheat can still be imported, but instability and shipping disruptions have hampered and delayed procurement. That has added to the pain for soba shop owners such as Ishihara who are already suffering as a global surge in commodity prices, coupled with the yen's plunge, has sent prices climbing.\n\nSoy sauce, flour, the vegetables used for tempura toppings and even the fish used for the broth have all risen in cost.\n\n\"The suppliers did all they could, but this time the situation's so bad there's no way to avoid raising prices. There are things I'll have to raise by 10 to 15 percent,\" Ishihara said in his narrow shop, steaming vats of water behind him.\n\nSoba is famous as a cheap meal served cold or hot, often slurped quickly by workers and students in narrow shops that may cut costs by doing without seats. The noodles' low calorie count and nutritious vitamin and mineral content makes them healthy too.\n\nIshihara's prices run from 290 yen ($2.25) up to 550 yen, with add-ons such as tempura and sets with rice costing more.\n\n\"Now, with the war, the cost of importing the buckwheat too has gone up,\" he said.\n\nDespite soba's iconic status, Japan in 2020 produced only 42% of its buckwheat needs, according to the Japan Soba Association. The gap is filled by imports, with Russia the third-largest source of buckwheat from 2018, according to the Agriculture Ministry.\n\nIn 2021, Russia rose to second, displacing China, and up until February it was No. 1.\n\nThen it invaded Ukraine, adding to the surge in commodities prices, while Japan's yen meanwhile plunged to a 20-year low. On top of that, sanctions and crackdowns on the Russian banking system, which have frozen Moscow out of international finance, have made it more difficult to settle some accounts.\n\nThe result has been headaches for soba importers and millers like Hua Yue at the purchasing department of Nikkoku Seifun Co Ltd in Matsumoto, a city in the traditional soba-producing area of Nagano.\n\nHer company imports buckwheat seeds from Russia, as well as other nations including China, in 800- to 1,000-tonne sacks, though she declined to give exact amounts or percentages of how much each country provides.\n\nSo far, the biggest problems have been delays and a 30% rise in the price of Russian buckwheat over the last six months, though that's partly due to an export stoppage last year that was resolved.\n\nWith Russia producing half the world's buckwheat, problems mean demand will shift to second-biggest producer China. But with China cutting buckwheat production every year, prices are likely to rise further.\n\n\"So it may become hard to eat soba at low-cost places,\" she added.\n\nIshihara's faithful customers, such as Keidai Fukuhara, who comes twice a week, shrug higher prices off. But even they may have their limits.\n\n\"It'll still be all right,\" the 27-year-old office worker said. \"That is, if the prices stay around 500 yen.\"\n\nReporting by Akiko Okamoto, Elaine Lies and Shinji Kitamura.

"Watch CBA's Dhar on Commodities Outlook", "description": "Watch CBA's Dhar on Commodities Outlook  Bloomberg", "content": "It has been such a beginning of the year for oil. We know that. But fifth month in a row of gains in the month of April. You know it just keeps moving and moving a movie. Is this as high as oil goes. And in fact with China's locked down driven or I should say intensified maybe slowdown does that further chip away at the demand for oil and mean that this is going to be about as high as it gets. Sure. So look I think it's a great question in terms of where we are in the market. Look we saw all the geopolitics and all the disruptions linked to the Russia Ukraine conflict come to the fore shortly after that war began in early March. But when we talk about what's happened more recently with China and the lockdowns you know we're talking maybe one one and a half percent of global oil demand effectively being cut out because of the China Covid lockdowns particularly in April. Now when we're talking about the supply disruptions it's key to look at what's happening with Russian oil supply. And in April itself that's down roughly about 1 percent off of off the market too. So in some ways we have seen some relative balances in terms of supply and demand shocks. But when we talk about what's going to happen through the year. Keep in mind that we are going to see the physical market likely tighten from here as more and more Russian supply gets curtailed. The real caveat to all this is can we see India and China come in and buy more Russian crude. Because what we do know is Europe is certainly going to move away from crude throughout 2022. So this physical market story isn't over yet. Yes. We've come to a point where supply and demand disruptions have really balanced out for now. But when we talk about what's going to happen through the year watch the physical market and watch Russian supply. And there is a good risk here that markets tighten it. In a recent note you said you thought that on Brent crude I believe you're referring to Brent crude that the top would be about 110 dollars a barrel in the second quarter and even a bit weaker in the fourth quarter. Have you changed your mind at all as the war drags on as these questions about supplies from Russia who buys them and sells them oil supplies. That is how that goes. I guess part of my answer he thought we were near the top because of Brent crude tops out at 110 and Robert 109. There you we're pretty near the top. Yeah sure. Of course. Look at this. In terms of the picture that's that's evolved I think the key change to our outlook was just how quickly we were going to see the EU come in and really look to reduce their imports from Russia because that's the key caveat here in terms of how markets will look in the next few months because if we see Europe look aggressively away from Russian oil and they have to find that oil elsewhere we could see Brent or any benchmark outside of Russia tighten considerably. And that is something that wasn't in the forecast of 110 in Q2 and Q3. But that is that is really the risk in the market right now in terms of markets prices coming off by the end of this year. I'd say it's really looking at at a US oil story that can we see US oil supply come up. Can we see enough demand destruction for markets to rebalance by the end of the year. That's really what we're talking about prices falling by year end. But when we talk about the next few months I'm keeping a very close eye on this German report that they're looking that that by the end of summer they may be okay without Russian oil imports. That's a very aggressive move for the next few months. And that's certainly tighten markets. The other weakening demand piece of course is China and Vivek just taking a look at this chart which shows that deepening contraction that we see are both in manufacturing as well as non manufacturing the pair my numbers that really came in pretty dire over the weekend. The manufacturing and non non manufacturing gauges both falling to two year lows and the fact that the Covid-19 Covid zero strategy. But also these lockdowns were not really part of the peace either. When it comes to expectations for China how does that play into the demand side of the story. Sure it's certainly more critical than we talk about base metal and bulk commodities particularly iron ore. And what we're seeing so far is that these lockdowns has certainly hurt near-term demand sentiment. But I think the redeeming picture and one that the markets are looking forward to is how is China going to achieve its economic growth target. We are more infrastructure spending and trying to provide relief to the property sector. And both of which have been mentioned by the Politburo in their quarterly meetings from Friday onward. So you know we certainly have some color that that we are going to see some demand rebound. The question is that can only really happen once these lockdowns end. And and you know for us that's a second half story. But certainly that's going to be a key story in terms of that price increase in the second half of this year. Yeah it's interesting because for copper aluminium we saw that initial reaction to the pledge to boost our economic stimulus and activity. Right. But that the hope that the gains really didn't hold. So what the market's really looking for when it comes to a bit more conviction. So you want to see action. Right now we've seen a big allowance in terms of infrastructure. But you can only get that activity on the ground happening once we see these disruptions to to mobility to two that are linked to these Covid-19 lockdowns. And you kind of saw that in the PMI if you sort of see the construction subcomponents of the known manufacturing PMI that dropped quite sharply last month and that tells you that it is difficult to get those infrastructure projects delivered. If we have these these restrictions on movement and we we need to see those end. And our view is that look Shanghai is probably going to see the worst of it. And coming into like the restrictions in Beijing and what we've seen coming forward could we see these these Covid-19 restrictions eased from from here on in. And really that's the expectation that look. Could this be. Was April going to be the worst than I think is going to get better from here. Because if that's the outlook then certainly second half is going to be a positive period for four Chinese commodities consumption. Just hard to say what the Chinese leadership is going to decide whether they soften this up a bit or not. But I won't ask you about the dollar. It has been climbing steadily. It kind of stalled out a bit on Friday ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday where they're supposed to start this aggressive rate hike path. How how if any way do you factor the dollar's path into your outlook for commodities. Sure so when it comes to more the financially linked commodity so you're looking at base metals or oil. The rising U.S. dollar is a negative force. But what we've seen play out is that there are other factors and whether that is the Russia supply issue or what's going to happen in China that has provided a more dominant force on on commodity prices then see what's happening with the US dollar. But certainly that factors in. But whether it's primary secondary tertiary right now it's looking more to be in the background. When we talk about some of these these key commodities right now. So if you were going to invest. If I were going to invest I said Vivek where do I want to make money on commodities right now. How do I do it. You know Warren Buffett just took a pretty decent Chevron straight stake and just about quadrupled it. You know Chevron announced it's going to do more stock buybacks et cetera. But what would you see. What's at play here for people who think this is going to last and they want to invest in it. Sure. So look it really depend on horizons if you're looking at it at what is going to happen in the next 10 years and this transition that we're talking about we're really going to see investment in base metals and copper for instance if you have to see what what the status quo is and what is expected until 2030. We're talking maybe 25 percent increase in copper supply. But if we have to hit say one and a half degree targets by 2030 we need to see copper supply growth maybe say 40 percent. So how well positioned is the market to supply that extra copper given that these ambitions are increasing. And that's where the opportunity is more in the longer term. And so you know copper and nickel are certainly the larger markets where where that investment can happen. But lithium has certainly shown its cards in terms of just how much is needed. And the price increases we've seen there certainly indicate that. But when you look at at fossil fuels if your outlook is over the next few years next four four years even you know natural gas for instance those markets know certainly look under invested in. If you think about how Europe is going to cut itself away from from Russia gas market you know look to be very tight for the foreseeable future. And LNG supply prices are likely going to be elevated. You know likely for years relative to what they were a year ago. So you know I think fossil fuels offer an opportunity in the near term. But if you're talking longer term then suddenly base metals and battery metals.", "medium": "Video", "links": [], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Russian oil supply", "weight": 0.09449914}, {"name": "oil supplies", "weight": 0.0908092}, {"name": "US oil supply", "weight": 0.08835382}, {"name": "Russian oil", "weight": 0.08133552}, {"name": "Russian oil imports", "weight": 0.079986446}, {"name": "Russian supply", "weight": 0.0794093}, {"name": "global oil demand", "weight": 0.078320645}, {"name": "copper supply", "weight": 0.0758726}, {"name": "copper supply growth", "weight": 0.07457931}, {"name": "year end", "weight": 0.07383844}], "topics": [{"name": "Markets"}], "categories": [{"name": "Finance"}], "entities": [{"data": "China", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 8}, {"data": "Russia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 9}, {"data": "Ukraine", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "India", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "EU", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Shanghai", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Beijing", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "U.S.", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Covid", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Russian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "German", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Chinese", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Europe", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Brent", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Vivek", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Covid", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Politburo", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Federal Reserve", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Chevron", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Robert", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Vivek", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Warren Buffett", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.09850028, "negative": 0.38981193, "neutral": 0.5116878}, "summary": "Now when we're talking about the supply disruptions it's key to look at what's happening with Russian oil supply.

European buyers pay for Russian gas in roubles or face their supply being cut off.\n\nRussia halted gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland last week after they refused to meet its demand to effectively

companies facing gas payment deadlines later this month, EU states have a pressing need to clarify whether companies can keep buying the fuel without breaching the EU's sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMoscow has said foreign gas buyers must deposit euros or dollars into an account at the privately owned Russian bank Gazprombank, which would convert them into roubles.\n\nThe European Commission has told countries that complying with Russia's scheme could breach EU sanctions, while also suggesting countries could make sanctions-compliant payments if they declare the payment complete once it has been made in euros and before its conversion into roubles.\n\nAfter Bulgaria, Denmark, Greece, Poland, Slovakia and others last week urged clearer advice, Brussels is drafting extra guidance.\n\nRussia on Friday said it saw no problem with its decree, which considers the buyer's obligation fulfilled only after the hard currency has been converted to roubles.\n\nWhile Bulgaria and Poland refused to engage with Moscow's scheme, Germany has echoed the Commission's workaround to allow companies to pay, and Hungary has said buyers can engage with Russia's mechanism. read more\n\nPayments in roubles can help to shelter Russia's economy from the impact of sanctions, while the fuel revenues can help to finance what it calls a special military

and Clean Air found.\n\nRussia supplies 40% of EU gas and 26% of its oil imports, a dependency that means Germany and others have so far resisted calls for an abrupt halt to Russian fuel imports for fear of economic damage.\n\nThe EU is edging towards a ban on imports of Russian oil by the end of the year, diplomats said, after talks between the Commission and EU countries at the weekend ahead of meetings this week.\n\nAmbassadors will discuss at a meeting on Wednesday a sixth package of EU sanctions against Moscow being drafted by the Commission.\n\nMinisters on Monday will also discuss the need to urgently secure non-Russian gas supplies and fill storage, as countries brace for supply shocks.\n\nDependency on Russian gas varies between countries, but analysts have said an immediate total cut-off of Russian gas would plunge countries, including Germany, into recession and require emergency measures such as factory closures to cope.\n\nAustria, Hungary, Italy and Slovakia also had reservations over the weekend about the idea of an oil embargo, diplomats said.\n\nThe Commission will later this month unveil plans to end Europe's dependency on Russian fossil fuels by 2027,
