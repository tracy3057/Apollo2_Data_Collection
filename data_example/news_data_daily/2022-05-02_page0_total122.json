The state has been ground zero for the national opioids crisis.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nRepublicans agree that values they view as traditional are at risk, but they\u2019re wrestling with whether isolationism is the answer to their misgivings about global interconnectedness.\n\nCLEVELAND \u2014 The homestretch of Ohio\u2019s contentious Republican Senate primary has revealed a party united in its conviction that American values, indeed the nation\u2019s way of life, are under attack, but divided on whether to embrace a strict isolationism to address its mounting misgivings about global interconnectedness and American leadership abroad. That divide has played out in policy differences \u2014 some subtle, others glaring \u2014 in the candidates\u2019 approach to the economy, immigration and foreign policy. The strains reflect the broader splits in a party undergoing something of an identity crisis, with ideological conservatives, the old Republican establishment of big business, and the Trump-inspired newer rank and file all pulling in different directions. At the same time, Republicans have been searching for ways to relate to former President Donald J. Trump himself: a few by taking tentative steps away from him, others by falling in line with him wholeheartedly. All of the candidates competing in the primary on Tuesday appear united in their fierce opposition to the Biden administration, as they have sought to paint a nation grappling with rising food and energy prices, a \u201cradical\u201d Democratic Party overreaching on issues of race and gender, and what they describe as apocalyptic conditions at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nBut the world beyond Mexico may be the brightest dividing line in the Republican Party, with conservatives split on what to do about Russian aggression, how far to distance the United States from its traditional alliances, and above all what to do about China, at once the nation\u2019s biggest competitor and one of its largest economic partners. Over the past weeks, Josh Mandel, Ohio\u2019s former treasurer and the onetime front-runner in the Senate primary, attacked a rival, Mike Gibbons, for making money off investments in China. J.D. Vance, the author and venture capital executive, attacked Mr. Mandel for accepting the help of the Club for Growth, the business-backed political group which he said supported business relations with China. And the sole woman in the race, Jane Timken, shares her last name with a company that is synonymous with Ohio manufacturing might \u2014 and that includes vast operations out of Shanghai. Whoever wins Tuesday will have to deal with those divisions in the coming general election campaign, especially since the presumed Democratic candidate, Representative Tim Ryan, has no qualms about blasting China while backing U.S. involvement elsewhere. \u201cVoters don\u2019t always have long memories here, especially after a primary campaign, but certainly the anti-China feelings are going to resonate for a long time,\u201d said Paul Beck, a professor emeritus of political science at Ohio State University and a longtime Ohio politics watcher. \u201cThey are hard-wired.\u201d\n\nMr. Vance, who won Mr. Trump\u2019s coveted endorsement, has even suggested, with a straight face but no evidence, that President Biden was intentionally allowing fentanyl into the country because of its potential to kill Republican voters, bringing the issue back to his mother, who as a nurse became addicted to pain medication. Fentanyl deaths did rise sharply in 2021, but they rose sharply in 2020 as well. \u201cMy family was very affected and is still very affected by the fentanyl that comes across the U.S. southern border into Ohio and into all parts of our country,\u201d he told an audience in Newark, Ohio, on Saturday. \u201cI believe that if the poison coming across the Mexican border today had been coming across 10 years ago, I would have lost my mother.\u201d Much of the debate and bluster on the border has been lacking in substance and filled with conjecture, with candidates proposing few policy solutions, conflating immigration and crime and resorting to language that dehumanizes unauthorized immigrants. But beneath the hard-right rhetoric, subtle differences can be seen between the pro-business, establishment Republicans of the past and the ascendant hard right. In stump speeches and a much-criticized campaign ad, Mr. Vance has falsely declared that people are entering the country to vote for Democrats. He has said he is in favor of an immigration process that creates legal paths to entering the country based on merit, rather than on familial ties, long a key feature of the nation\u2019s immigration system. And he opposes H-1B visas that allow employers to temporarily hire immigrant workers in various industries. At the other end of the issue is Matt Dolan, an Ohio state senator who has sought to put some distance between himself and the former president. Mr. Dolan, too, talks tough on immigration and the need to stop the flow of fentanyl. But he is just as concerned about economic development, supporting tax cuts, training for workers and reduced regulations for small businesses. And he favors the immigrant work visas, saying businesses rely on them.\n\nPerhaps the most glaring examples in Ohio of the forces warring within the Republican Party have unfolded over competition with China, the war in Ukraine and American leadership abroad. Again setting himself apart, Mr. Vance has argued against deepening American involvement on Ukraine\u2019s behalf \u2014 despite what many see as the gravest threat to world order in decades. Mr. Vance opposed the establishment of a European-led no-fly zone over Ukraine, and has drawn criticism for a statement he made in February in which he said he did not \u201creally care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.\u201d He has since sought to assure audiences he feels Ukrainians\u2019 pain, but has doubled down on his stance against U.S. intervention. \u201cAt the end of the day, however tragic we find these images of what is going on in Ukraine, this is not our fight,\u201d Mr. Vance said in a debate last month. The distinctions could also be seen in the surrogates the Ohio candidates brought in to campaign with them in the final stretch.\n\nMr. Mandel chose as his wingman for the final weekend Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, who in 2016 was Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest threat and remains fiercely conservative in ways the former president never was. Mr. Cruz has consistently attacked Mr. Biden as weak on foreign policy, going so far as to blame him for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. And Mr. Cruz, like Republican congressional leaders, has shied away from some of Mr. Trump\u2019s broader attacks on corporate America \u2014 especially the pharmaceutical industry \u2014 which often echoed Democratic talking points. Mr. Vance, by contrast, stumped over the weekend with two of the most polarizing figures of the far right: Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida. Ms. Greene railed against the \u201cforever wars\u201d started under George W. Bush and talked up what she called \u201cthe civil war in the G.O.P.,\u201d while Mr. Gaetz blasted the leaders of his own party and said he and Ms. Greene needed backup in Washington \u2014 backup that Mr. Vance would provide.\n\nMr. Gibbons, for his part, campaigned with Senator Rand Paul, the Kentuckian who espouses small government, low taxes and the avoidance of foreign entanglements at all cost. And Mr. Gibbons embraced a fringe movement to hold a constitutional convention aimed at curbing federal power, and mocked the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s new effort to counter disinformation as an Orwellian Ministry of Truth. One area in which there is broad agreement among the party\u2019s Senate candidates is on the conservative values many Ohio Republicans say they hold dear, from old standbys like support for gun rights and opposition to abortion, to current causes like preventing transgender women from playing women\u2019s sports and giving parents greater control over how race and gender are taught in schools. On those issues, consensus among the candidates was so fully realized that voters at events in Cleveland seemed widely split over whom to support, and many were still undecided. In Port Clinton, where Ms. Timken, Mr. Gibbons and Mr. Dolan all worked the crowd at a Knights of Columbus chicken barbecue lunch, Lisa Slobodzian said she was still sifting through her direct mail and studying the candidates\u2019 positions. \u201cI want power back to the people,\u201d said Ms. Slobodzian, 57, a retired national parks ranger and law enforcement specialist, digging into her plate. \u201cThey should decide what their kids are taught in schools, and not some government agency.\u201d", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://nida.nih.gov/drug-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates", "https://www.axios.com/jd-vances-investments-made-use-of-h-1b-visas-he-opposes-7452f979-d4b7-4dd8-8c52-6cd78f2b2684.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/17/health/drug-overdoses-fentanyl-deaths.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/28/us/gop-vote-fraud-immigrants.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/17/us/politics/republicans-biden-ukraine.html?auth=linked-google1tap", "https://twitter.com/RonFilipkowski/status/1520201563330990080"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": "11f7c7010d154dd692756aa887ff5345", "name": "Jazmine Ulloa"}, {"id": "3e93c2f7e1884cbabf07e581627b737c", "name": "Jonathan Weisman"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "many Ohio Republicans", "weight": 0.059131064}, {"name": "Mr. Vance", "weight": 0.05602963}, {"name": "Mr. Biden", "weight": 0.054476496}, {"name": "Mr. Gaetz", "weight": 0.052579783}, {"name": "Ohio", "weight": 0.05250732}, {"name": "Mr. Gibbons", "weight": 0.052191693}, {"name": "Ohio manufacturing might", "weight": 0.052082665}, {"name": "Ohio State University", "weight": 0.05176707}, {"name": "American leadership", "weight": 0.05132115}, {"name": "Mr. Mandel", "weight": 0.051049333}], "topics": [{"name": "Ohio"}], "categories": [{"name": "Politics"}], "entities": [{"data": "Norwalk", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ohio", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 11}, {"data": "CLEVELAND", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "U.S.-Mexico", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "the United States", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "China", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Shanghai", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Newark", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ukraine", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "Texas", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Russia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "America", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Georgia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Florida", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Washington", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Port Clinton", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Republicans", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 9}, {"data": "American", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Russian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Democratic", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "European", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ukrainians", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Kentuckian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Senate", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Democratic Party", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Republican Party", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "the Club for Growth", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ohio State University", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Knights of Columbus", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Trump", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Biden", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Josh Mandel", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Mike Gibbons", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "J.D.

"Russia Women To Be Replaced By Portugal At UEFA Women\u2019s Euro 2022  Forbes", "content": "Over two months after excluding Russia from its soccer competitions, the European governing body finally excluded their women's national team from the UEFA Women's Euro in England this July, replacing them in the finals with the team they defeated in the qualification play-offs, Portugal.\n\nOn February 28, the world and European governing bodies issued a joint-statement which said that \"all Russian teams, whether national representative teams or club teams, shall be suspended from participation in both FIFA and UEFA competitions until further notice.\" However, they did not go so far as to replace the women's national team in July's tournament in the hope that the war in Ukraine may have come to a conclusion in the meantime.\n\nTwo months on, with the war showing no sign of ending, UEFA's hand has been forced. Yesterday, they confirmed Russia's exclusion from the women's European Championship, as well as the ongoing FIFA Women's World Cup qualification campaign and next season's UEFA Women's Champions League.\n\nThey stated that \"further to its 28 February 2022 decision to suspend all Russian representative teams and clubs from participating in UEFA competition matches until further notice, the UEFA Executive Committee today took a series of decisions relating to the implications of that decision for its upcoming competitions, in order to ensure their smooth staging in a safe and secure environment for all those concerned.\"\n\nIf Russia's exclusion from the UEFA Women's Euro seemed increasingly inevitable for each day the war in Ukraine continued, their replacement with Portugal was not certain. Speaking at the Financial Times Business of Football Summit in March, UEFA President Aleksander \u010ceferin gave hope to the Czech Republic and Ukraine, the other teams eliminated in the qualification play-offs, by saying \"the other one (replacement team) is the thing we are discussing. We will probably have a draw between the teams who nearly qualified. But that has not been decided.\"\n\nIn the end, Portugal, who lost 1-0 on aggregate to Russia over two legs in a play-off in April 2021 were promoted to replace the team that eliminated them from the tournament. Thus, UEFA followed the precedent it set 30 years ago in the only other instance of a country being excluded from its European Championship tournament.\n\nThen, Yugoslavia were excluded as a result of the ongoing civil war and break-up the country. As a result the team they qualified ahead of, Denmark, replaced them in the men's European Championship in 1992. Despite having only ten days in which to prepare for the finals, Denmark implausibly went on to win the tournament.\n\nThe Portugal women's national team will therefore go into Group C of the UEFA Women's Euro in July alongside reigning champions, the Netherlands, Sweden and their first opponents, Switzerland. Unlike, their group opponents, the Portuguese team, who last played in April have no preparatory matches scheduled between now and July.\n\nTheir head coach, Francisco Neto said, \"I begin by saying that we would exchange our presence at this European Championship for a world without war and without the shocking events that we have been following on television: bombings, deaths, children, women, entire families in suffering and on the run.\"\n\n\"When we received the invitation from UEFA to fill the vacancy in Russia, and participate in an event of this magnitude, we accepted with great honor and we will prepare ourselves in the best way to compete in the competition, in what will be our second European finals.\"\n\nThe Swedish women's national team coach, Peter Gerhardsson also backed the UEFA announcement. \"This is a decision I fully support, given what has happened for a long time and is still going on in Ukraine. And just like then, my thoughts are still with the people there, with the hope that the war will end as soon as possible.\"\n\nHe also welcomed the clarity it offered his own team in finally discovering their third group-stage opponents in the tournament. \"It is of course good that we have now received a decision to relate to the current European Championships this summer, and we now have the opportunity to continue working with the preparations and analysis of this summer's opponents.\"\n\nRussia's exclusion from the FIFA Women's World Cup qualification campaign run by UEFA means their previous results have been expunged from Group E in which they had sat in second place behind Denmark. As a consequence of this, Denmark, who had defeated Russia 3-1 at home but still had to travel to play them away, today were guaranteed automatic qualification to the World Cup next year in Australia and New Zealand. It will the first time Denmark have played in the finals since 2007.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.forbes.com/sites/robreischel/2021/09/26/the-good-bad-and-ugly-from-the-green-bay-packers-win-over-the-san-francisco-49ers/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2021/09/26/wwe-extreme-rules-2021-results-winners-news-and-notes-as-roman-reigns-beats-the-demon/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinasettimi/2021/09/21/the-worlds-highest-paid-soccer-players-2021--uniteds-cristiano-ronaldo-reclaims-top-spot-from-psgs--lionel-messi/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/asifburhan/2022/03/01/no-decision-made-over-russian-participation-at-uefa-womens-euro/?sh=7db434b5460b"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": null, "name": "Asif Burhan"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "replacement team", "weight": 0.0931274}, {"name": "club teams", "weight": 0.09058141}, {"name": "UEFA competition matches", "weight": 0.087558605}, {"name": "UEFA", "weight": 0.07920579}, {"name": "European Championship", "weight": 0.07603237}, {"name": "UEFA President Aleksander \u010ceferin", "weight": 0.0744198}, {"name": "war", "weight": 0.06455947}, {"name": "automatic qualification", "weight": 0.062111925}, {"name": "Ukraine", "weight": 0.06109952}, {"name": "European Championships", "weight": 0.060942616}], "topics": [{"name": "Portugal"}, {"name": "Russia"}, {"name": "Russia-Ukraine War"}, {"name": "European Football"}, {"name": "UEFA"}], "categories": [{"name": "Sports"}], "entities": [{"data": "Russia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 7}, {"data": "England", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Portugal", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Ukraine", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "the Czech Republic", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Yugoslavia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Denmark", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Netherlands", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Sweden", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Switzerland", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Australia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "New Zealand", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "European", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Russian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Portuguese", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Swedish", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the UEFA Women's Euro", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "European Championship", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "World Cup", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "FIFA", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "UEFA", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 10}, {"data": "Group E", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Aleksander \u010ceferin", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Francisco Neto", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Peter Gerhardsson", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.026270043, "negative": 0.66082704, "neutral": 0.31290293}, "summary": "\n\nOn February 28, the world and European governing bodies issued a joint-statement which said that \"all Russian teams, whether national representative teams or club teams, shall be suspended from participation in both FIFA and UEFA competitions until further notice.\" \n\nThey stated that \"further to its 28 February 2022 decision to suspend all Russian representative teams and clubs from participating in UEFA competition matches until further notice, the UEFA Executive Committee today took a series of decisions relating to the implications of that decision for its upcoming competitions, in order to ensure their smooth staging in a safe and secure environment for all those concerned.\" Speaking at the Financial Times Business of Football Summit in March, UEFA President Aleksander \u010ceferin gave hope to the Czech Republic and Ukraine, the other teams eliminated in the qualification play-offs, by saying \"the other one (replacement team) is the thing we are discussing.

Marjorie Taylor Greene on Monday barnstormed around her congressional district on the first day of early voting in Georgia, telling voters that woke Democrats and weak-kneed Republicans are presiding over a \u201cbroken\u201d federal government that has left Americans like them in the lurch.\n\nThe polarizing Ms. Greene, bidding for a second term in the 14th Congressional District, says voters are suffering from the failure of Congress to address the rising costs of food and gas, and the unprecedented mess at the southern border, which, she says, would be her top priority if reelected.\n\n\u201cThis is how people feel all over America, and unfortunately rural Americans and most Americans haven\u2019t had a voice for a very long time,\u201d the 47-year-old married mother of three said after casting her vote. \u201cOur government is very broken.\u201d\n\nMs. Greene insists things will change for the better \u2014 for the country and for her \u2014 if Republicans flip control of the House in the midterm elections. The current Democratic majority, she argues, has tied her hands, but things will change dramatically if the GOP wins big in the midterm elections as many polls now suggest.\n\n\u201cWhat I look forward to do when we take back the House is I will have great committee assignments,\u201d Ms. Greene said in a debate Sunday. \u201c[House Minority Leader] Kevin McCarthy and leadership have already promised them to me, and we look forward to holding Democrats accountable for all the corruption and horrible things they\u2019ve done in our country.\u201d\n\nMs. Greene won her seat in the 2020 election, but was stripped of her committee assignments less than a month after the Jan. 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol. Majority Democrats made the move citing what they said were her past incendiary comments and apparent support of violence against lawmakers.\n\nSEE ALSO: Republicans making critical gains among Hispanic and non-White voters ahead of 2022 election\n\nHer no-holds barred style, penchant for controversial comments and willingness to take on members of both parties has made her into a hyper-polarizing figure. She is even facing a legal battle from a group who claims her \u201cpro-insurrection\u201d comments regarding the Jan. 6 events disqualify her from the ballot.\n\nMs. Greene embraces former President Trump and promotes his claims the 2020 election was stolen, including in Georgia, where President Biden became the first Democrat since Bill Clinton to carry the state in a presidential election. Ms. Greene also says she welcomes a GOP civil war, seeing it as necessary to weed out more moderate members \u2014 RINOs \u2014 and give conservatives a bigger voice in the party.\n\nAs far as accomplishments, Ms Greene tells voters she pulled $6 million in federal funds into the district, and brought transparency to the House by forcing roll-call votes on hundreds of pieces of legislation that otherwise would have flown under the radar.\n\nHer high profile and confrontational style have not given her a clear path to re-nomination, however, in the state\u2019s May 24 primary.\n\nFive GOP rivals are running in the primary, saying she has become too partisan and too controversial to legislate effectively, even in a Republican-run House.\n\nJennifer Strahan, a health care executive who has gained support from the likes of Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, said the interest in her candidacy is a direct result of the misgivings Republicans have about Ms. Greene.\n\n\u201cThe individuals who are supporting me aren\u2019t supporting me because they know me,\u201d Mrs. Strahan said. \u201cThey are supporting me because they know Rep. Greene.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Ms. Greene defended her style, saying it fits her district. Tucked into the far northwestern corner of the state bordering Tennessee and Alabama, the 14th District went for President Trump over Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 election by a 73% to 25% margin. The district is 77% white and the largest cities have populations of less than 50,000 residents.\n\n\u201cI am not willing to cross lines,\u201d Ms. Greene said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m saying, \u2018Lines have been drawn in the sand,\u2019 I seriously mean it and I think my constituents and supporters really support that because they are not used to seeing that from politicians in Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love Marjorie because she is a doer,\u201d said Lyndon Smith, a retired Marine. \u201cShe is shaking things up up there. I\u2019m sick and tired of business as usual and our country being destroyed.\u201d\n\nMr. Smith said Ms. Greene deserves credit for helping to block the \u201ccommunist, socialist\u201d agenda that is being pushed by House Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2014 whom he described as \u201cthe devil.\u201d\n\nMs. Greene is \u201cwilling to take a hit and she\u2019s willing to be confrontational, whereas almost all the men run for cover,\u201d he said.\n\nMs. Greene\u2019s race is playing out under new voting rules Gov. Brian Kemp and the GOP-controlled legislature passed last year, one that shrunk the time window for requesting an absentee ballot, established new ID requirements for absentee ballots, and curbed the number of ballot drop boxes and the times they are available. Democrats say the law seeks to suppress the vote in minority communities. Republicans say that\u2019s not the case.\n\nAngered at the failure of senior Georgia Republicans to back his election fraud claims, Mr. Trump also has thrown his weight behind former Sen. David Perdue\u2019s primary challenge to Mr. Kemp and Rep. Jody Hice\u2019s challenge to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Mr. Greene declined on Monday to say who she voted for in those primary contests.\n\nMs. Greene also clashed with a television reporter Monday when asked whether she is concerned her recent comments about Nazis in Ukraine and 2018 social media post about the Rothschild family has stoked antisemitism in Georgia.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lying, stop right now you\u2019re lying,\u201d she said. \u201cI have one of the most pro-Israel records in Congress.

Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation expert with experience working on Ukraine and Russia issues, was tapped to helm the board, along with two senior DHS officials, including acting Principal Deputy General Counsel Jen Daskal.\n\nJankowicz's appointment quickly drew condemnation from GOP lawmakers and right-wing media, who pointed to her past tweets and statements regarding Hunter Biden's laptop and Christopher Steele, the author of the so-called Steele Dossier.\n\nJankowicz weighed in more recently on Elon's Musk's bid to buy Twitter, writing, \"I shudder to think about if free speech absolutists were taking over more platforms, what that would look like for the marginalized communities ... which are already shouldering ... disproportionate amounts of this abuse.\"\n\nThe Republican-led backlash was swift. GOP Reps. John Katko of New York and Mike Turner of Ohio sent a letter t o Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, raising \"serious concerns\" with the initiative under Jankowicz. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri similarly wrote a letter to Mayorkas, arguing the board is \"dangerous and un-American\" and calling for it to be dissolved.\n\nThe board, though, is an internal working group and doesn't have operational authority, instead serving in a more advisory role. It's intended to gather best practices and support counter-disinformation activities, not monitor Americans, Mayorkas said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday.\n\n\"It works to ensure that the way in which we address threats, the connectivity between threats and acts of violence that are addressed without infringing on free speech, protecting civil rights and civil liberties, the right of privacy,\" Mayorkas said, conceding that the department could've done a better job of explaining the group's role.\n\n\"This working group, internal working group, will draw from best practices and communicate those best practices to the operators because the board does not have operational authority,\" Mayorkas added.\n\nIn a fact sheet released Monday afternoon, DHS said Mayorkas has asked department officials to enhance the public's trust in the group.\n\nMayorkas has also asked the bipartisan Homeland Security Advisory Council to recommend ways DHS can address disinformation while \"protecting free speech and other fundamental rights,\" according to the fact sheet.\n\nJamie Gorelick -- the council's co-chair and a former US deputy attorney general -- will lead the effort along with Michael Chertoff, a member of the council who was secretary of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush.\n\n\"There has been confusion about the working group, its role, and its activities. The reaction to this working group has prompted DHS to assess what steps we should take to build the trust needed for the Department to be effective in this space,\" the fact sheet stated, adding that the group will release quarterly reports about its work to Congress.\n\nCNN has reached out to Jankowicz for additional comment. Jankowicz announced her appointment on Twitter last week and responded to some of the criticism regarding a tweet on Hunter Biden's laptop during a 2020 presidential debate.\n\nThe board will also not be putting out fact checks, as critics have suggested.\n\nJankowicz has focused on disinformation and Eastern Europe for years and advised the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry on the subject in 2016 and 2017, according to her website. She is fluent in Russian, and her book \"How to Lose the Information War\" examines how five Western governments have dealt with Russian disinformation.\n\nDespite her expertise, critics argue she's biased against claims of Democrats' misdeeds, former President Donald Trump's record, Covid-19 measures and free speech, among other issues. In a TikTok video posted prior to her appointment to lead the board, for example, Jankowicz singled out Rudy Giuliani and TikTok influencers to a Mary Poppins jingle.\n\n\"When Rudy Giuliani shared bad intel from Ukraine or when TikTok influencers say Covid can't cause pain, they're laundering disinfo and we really should take note, and not support their lies with our wallet, voice, or vote,\" she said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki came to Jankowicz's defense on Monday.\n\n\"The woman you noted has extensive experience and has done extensive work addressing disinformation,\" Psaki said. \"She has testified before Congress; she has testified in Europe. She has worked closely with the Ukrainians and has unique expertise, especially at this moment we're facing.\"\n\nIn network interviews Sunday, Mayorkas also stood by Jankowicz. Asked about Republican criticism of Jankowicz and her ability to be objective by CNN's Dana Bash, Mayorkas replied: \"Eminently qualified, a renowned expert in the field of disinformation.\"\n\nThe concept of the board dates to last year. At the time, Homeland Security officials began discussing a group to provide guidance on policies and privacy protection questions, given that agencies within the department were already collecting information for purposes related to their missions, according to John Cohen, the former acting head of the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis.\n\nOne of the questions the working group could help with, officials thought, was whether agencies could share information with one another that they had obtained through their own authorities, Cohen said.\n\n\"Every threat area of concern to the department is impacted by the fact that foreign intelligence services, terrorist groups, criminal organizations are spreading disinformation via internet-based communication platforms,\" Cohen said.\n\nThe \"Disinformation Governance Board\" focuses first on disinformation surrounding human migration into the US and potential disinformation threats from Russia aimed at US critical infrastructure, DHS said in a news release last week.\n\nRussian disinformation campaigns against Americans have gone on for years, including during election cycles. US officials are always watching for new signs of Kremlin-backed efforts to sow divisions, particularly in light of Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, US challenges in dealing with migrants trying to enter the US are exacerbated by smugglers who \"make a profit by spreading false information that endangers lives,\" DHS said in last week's news release.\n\nLast week, during congressional hearings, Mayorkas warned of a rise in misinformation and disinformation trying to target the integrity of the election system.\n\n\"We are seeing a rise in misinformation and disinformation that is attempting to strike at the integrity of the election system and people's right to vote,\" Mayorkas said when asked by Rep. Hank Johnson, a Georgia Democrat, about radicalization before the upcoming 2022 elections.\n\nMayorkas said he had addressed secretaries of state throughout the country a few weeks ago to discuss efforts to ensure the safety of officials and the electoral system.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://twitter.com/wiczipedia/status/1519438518551994369"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": "09bdae01c91e4bf59a79c6590ddcad3b", "name": "Priscilla Alvarez"}, {"id": "d3c8731e363244c8b4a358f22e8949b6", "name": "Sean Lyngaas"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "disinformation", "weight": 0.06491791}, {"name": "Russian disinformation", "weight": 0.06477027}, {"name": "Mayorkas", "weight": 0.06429476}, {"name": "potential disinformation threats", "weight": 0.064277105}, {"name": "Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas", "weight": 0.06350016}, {"name": "Alejandro Mayorkas", "weight": 0.063158944}, {"name": "internal working group", "weight": 0.061514337}, {"name": "Russian disinformation campaigns", "weight": 0.061510235}, {"name": "Last week", "weight": 0.06097989}, {"name": "last week", "weight": 0.06097989}], "topics": [{"name": "GOP"}, {"name": "Joe Biden"}, {"name": "Media"}], "categories": [{"name": "Politics"}], "entities": [{"data": "CNN", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "The Department of Homeland Security", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "DHS", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 7}, {"data": "the \"Disinformation Governance Board,", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "GOP", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Twitter", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Homeland Security Advisory Council", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Congress", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "TikTok", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "White House", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Kremlin", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Republicans", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "un-American", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Western", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Russian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Democrats", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Ukrainians", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "US", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 10}, {"data": "Ukraine", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "New York", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ohio", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Missouri", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Georgia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Nina Jankowicz", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 11}, {"data": "Jen Daskal", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Hunter Biden's", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Christopher Steele", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Elon", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Musk", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "John Katko", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Mike Turner", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Alejandro Mayorkas", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 12}, {"data": "Josh Hawley", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Jamie Gorelick", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Michael Chertoff", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "George W.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov drew sharp criticism Monday from Israel for asserting during an interview with an Italian news outlet that Adolf Hitler \u201chad Jewish blood.\u201d\n\nMr. Lavrov made the assertion while defending Russian claims that it invaded Ukraine to \u201cde-Nazify\u201d the country, despite the fact that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish and had family members killed in the Holocaust.\n\nThe Kremlin was also facing mounting speculation and unconfirmed reports in Western news outlets that Mr. Putin may be ill, allegedly suffering from Parkinson\u2019s disease and possibly thyroid or abdominal cancer. The speculation has spiraled since a Kremlin video last week showed Mr. Putin tightly gripping a table and slouching with what appeared to be a bloated face. A separate clip seemed to show the Russian president\u2019s hand flapping uncontrollably as he prepared to meet Belarusian ally President Alexander Lukashenko.\n\nSEE ALSO: Pentagon sees \u2018minimal\u2019 progress for Russians in renewed assault\n\nThe Daily Mail, a British tabloid, reported recently that Mr. Putin is set to undergo cancer surgery, according to an unnamed \u201cKremlin insider\u201d cited on the popular Telegram channel General SVR. The Daily Mail claimed General SVR first began reporting that Mr. Putin had abdominal cancer and Parkinson\u2019s 18 months ago.\n\nA report last week by the German outlet Deutsche Welle stressed that the reports are purely speculation. The outlet cited interviews with multiple doctors who had studied the video footage of Mr. Putin and concluded that a wide range of factors could have contributed to the Russian president\u2019s mannerisms and appearance in the footage.\n\nThe first civilians evacuated from the bombed-out steel plant that has become the last stronghold of Ukrainian fighters in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol slowly made their way toward safety Monday, as others who managed to escape the city described terrifying weeks of bombardment and deprivation.\n\nMore than 100 civilians \u2014 including elderly women and mothers with small children \u2014 left the sprawling, rubble-strewn Azovstal steel mill on Sunday and set out in buses and ambulances for the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia, about 140 miles to the northwest, according to authorities and video released by the two sides.\n\nAt least some of the civilians were apparently taken to a village controlled by Russia-backed separatists. The Russian military said that some chose to stay in separatist areas, while dozens left for Ukrainian-held territory. Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of taking civilians against their will to Russia or Russian-controlled areas \u2014 charges the Kremlin denies.\n\nSEE ALSO: More than 25% of Russian units sent to Ukraine are \u2018combat ineffective,\u2019 British military says\n\nAs many as 100,000 civilians overall may still be in Mariupol, which had a prewar population of more than 400,000. Russian forces have pounded much of the city to rubble, trapping civilians with little food, water, heat or medicine.\n\nMariupol, which is situated within Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region, is key to Russia\u2019s campaign in the war-torn country\u2019s east. Its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, allow Russia to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops for fighting elsewhere in the region.\n\nMr. Zelenskyy said he hoped more people would be able to leave Mariupol in an organized evacuation on Monday. The city council told residents wanting to leave to gather at a shopping mall to wait for buses.\n\nMr. Zelenskyy told Greek state television that remaining civilians in the steel plant were afraid to board buses because they feared they would be taken to Russia. He said he had been assured by the U.N. that they would be allowed to go to areas his government controls.\n\nThe steel plant evacuation, if successful, would represent rare progress in easing the human cost of the almost 10-week war. Previous attempts to open safe corridors out of the southern port city and other places have broken down, with Ukrainian officials accusing Russian forces of shooting and shelling along agreed-on evacuation routes.\n\nU.S. intelligence says it believes Russians alienated by Mr. Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine may be trying to get in touch with U.S. intelligence \u2014 and the CIA wants them to go to the darknet.\n\nThe agency signaled a new push Monday to promote its presence on a part of the internet accessible only through specialized tools that provide more anonymity. The CIA has a darknet site that has the same features as its regular homepage but accessible only through the Tor internet browser, which has encryption features not available on most regular browsers.\n\nThe effort comes as U.S. officials closely monitor intelligence reports on Russian military activity inside Ukraine.\n\nA senior U.S. defense official told reporters on background that a majority of the dozen Russian battalion tactical groups that had been massing near Mariupol in recent weeks have now moved north to other battlefronts in eastern Ukraine. The official described Russia\u2019s progress at consolidating its forces in the divided Donbas region of Ukraine as unimpressive so far.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll move in and declare victory, then withdraw their troops only to let the Ukrainians take it back,\u201d the Defense Department official told reporters at the Pentagon. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of back and forth [with] minimal progress at best.\u201d\n\nMorale remains low among a number of the Russian soldiers who have taken part in what they believed would be a quick military campaign, only to see it drag on for months with no clear end in sight, officials said.\n\n\u201cThey are still suffering from poor command and control [and] less than ideal logistics,\u201d the Defense Department official said. \u201cThey still have not solved all their logistics problems.\u201d\n\nWhile the U.S. official said the Russian forces made minimal gains over the weekend, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry offered an alternative narrative on Monday, asserting that its forces had struck dozens of Ukrainian military targets in the east.\n\nDefense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said Russian warplanes fired precision-guided missiles to hit more than three dozen Ukrainian targets, including concentrations of troops and weapons, over the last 24 hours. He said a Russian air strike also destroyed an ammunition depot near Chervone in the Zaporizhzhia region, and that a Ukrainian MiG-29 fighter jet was downed near the eastern town of Slovyansk. The announcements couldn\u2019t be independently confirmed.\n\nUkraine, meanwhile, claimed Monday that its forces had sunk a pair of Russian patrol boats in the Black Sea, using TB2 drones supplied by Turkey.\n\nOfficials said the action took place off the coast of Snake Island, which had been the scene of a radio exchange that went viral early in the conflict between Ukrainian fighters and a Russian warship, the Moskva, which itself sank in mid-April following a Ukrainian missile attack.\n\nUkrainian officials said the patrol boats, known as Raptors, were hit at daybreak on Monday. Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Defense released a video that appeared to show the attack in progress. \u201cBayraktar is working,\u201d Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, chief of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, said using the local name for the Turkish drone system that has proven highly effective in the nine-week war.\n\nThe patrol boats were reportedly being used to evacuate Russian troops from Snake Island when they were attacked by the drones. The boats can reportedly transport up to 20 people with a range of about 100 miles.\n\nIn other developments Monday, European Union energy ministers met in Brussels to discuss new sanctions against the Kremlin, which could include restrictions on Russian oil. But some Russia-dependent members of the 27-nation bloc, including Hungary and Slovakia, are wary of taking tough action.\n\nThe 27-nation EU imports around 40% of the gas it consumes from Russia.\n\nWhile the matter remains under debate, Poland urged its European Union partners on Monday to unite and impose sweeping measures against the import of Russia\u2019s oil and natural gas, and not to cave to pressure from the Putin government to pay for Russian gas in rubles.\n\n\u201cWe will call for immediate sanctions on Russian oil and gas,\u201d said Polish Climate and Environment Minister Anna Moskwa. \u201cThis is the next, and urgent, and absolute step.\u201d\n\nThe Kremlin-controlled energy giant Gazprom cut supplies to Bulgaria and Poland last week after Mr. Putin said \u201cunfriendly\u201d countries must start paying in rubles. Gazprom has claimed Bulgaria and Poland failed to pay their bills in April.\n\nFriction over the issue continues as Washington seeks to re-open its embassy in Kyiv.\n\nAmerican diplomats made a day trip into Ukraine Monday, with U.S. Embassy Charge d\u2019Affaires Kristina Kvien attending a news conference in Lviv to highlight the diplomatic return. American diplomats relocated from the Kyiv embassy to Lviv before the war, then pulled out entirely after Russia began its war on Ukraine in February.\n\nSeparately, a top-level U.S. congressional delegation led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was in Warsaw on Monday to express gratitude to Poland for its humanitarian and other support for Ukraine.\n\nMs. Pelosi and a half dozen U.S. lawmakers met with President Andrzej Duda and Polish lawmakers in Warsaw. The visit followed a weekend visit to Kyiv where they met with Mr. Zelenskyy, pledging to support his country until it defeats Russia.\n\u2022 Mike Glenn contributed to this article, which is based in

He will say the bravery demonstrated by those who have sought to defend their country from Russian invaders means the war will come to be known as Ukraine\u2019s \u201cfinest hour\u201d, too.\n\nThe speech to Ukrainian MPs reciprocates the move made by the country\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who gave a historic speech to the House of Commons in March.\n\nJohnson will become the first world leader to address the Verkhovna Rada since the conflict began, and seek to show critics he is focused on international affairs despite continuing questions over his leadership.\n\nMeanwhile, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has faced fresh questions from Labour about why a company his wife holds a stake in, Infosys, is still reportedly operating in Russia despite assurances it would pull out of the country.\n\nThe Indian tech company said it would shut its office in Moscow after the invasion of Ukraine and ministers have urged British businesses to cease trading in Russia to help stymie its economy and avoid feeding Vladimir Putin\u2019s war chest.\n\nWith Russia attempting to focus its attention on the south and eastern regions of Ukraine after failing to take the capital, Kyiv, Johnson will attempt to provide a morale boost. He will tell the Ukrainian parliament: \u201cWhen my country faced the threat of invasion during the second world war, our parliament \u2013 like yours \u2013 continued to meet throughout the conflict, and the British people showed such unity and resolve that we remember our time of greatest peril as our finest hour.\n\n\u201cThis is Ukraine\u2019s finest hour, an epic chapter in your national story that will be remembered and recounted for generations to come. Your children and grandchildren will say that Ukrainians taught the world that the brute force of an aggressor counts for nothing against the moral force of a people determined to be free.\u201d\n\nJohnson visited Kyiv last month and other senior western politicians have been to the city recently as well, including the US House of Representatives speaker, Nancy Pelosi.\n\nSunak was urged by Labour to say when Infosys\u2019s Russian office would close down and if his family was financially benefiting from the company\u2019s continued presence there.

Michael Carpenter, the American ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said that the Kremlin would likely stage \u201csham\u201d elections in the Russian-backed separatist territories of Donetsk and Luhansk in mid-May to formally seize control of both. The ambassador would not specify the origin of these reports or how he was able to make such a prediction. A similar referendum in Kherson, in southern Ukraine, could follow, he said. The Russian language is dominant in all three areas.\n\n\u201cThis is straight out of the Kremlin\u2019s playbook,\u201d Mr. Carpenter told reporters at the State Department on Monday. He said it was not certain that Russia would ultimately move to annex any of the regions, much less be successful in doing so, but that \u201cthis is the planning that we are seeing.\u201d President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia recognized the independence of the so-called Donetsk People\u2019s Republic and Luhansk People\u2019s Republic a few days before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine began in late February. Moscow-backed separatists in the regions have been fighting against Ukrainian forces since 2014. Mr. Putin annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 just hours after 97 percent of voters in a referendum there approved seceding from Ukraine. The vote was criticized as fraudulent, and much of the world has since refused to recognize Crimea as part of the Russian Federation. Mr. Carpenter said it was also possible that Russia\u2019s leaders would try to take over other parts of Ukraine, by imposing \u201cpuppets and proxies\u201d in local governments and forcing out democratically elected officials. He said that this had appeared to be Moscow\u2019s initial aim in Kyiv \u2014 a plan that included installing a new constitution in Ukraine \u2014 but that Russian forces had been forced to drop back to the country\u2019s east and south after they were unable to take the capital.\n\nNow, he said, Moscow appears intent on imposing its school curriculum, currency and local leadership in areas where Russian forces are suspected of abducting political opponents, educators and journalists, and cutting off internet services to isolate residents from independent sources of information. Mr. Carpenter acknowledged there was little that the O.S.C.E. could do to stop Russia, although he cited efforts by the West and other international allies to hammer Moscow with economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation. He said the organization was working to distribute humanitarian relief to Ukrainian people who have been wounded in the war or forced from their homes since Russia invaded, and was helping to document war crimes and other human rights abuses for future prosecutions. \u201cPart of what we\u2019re trying to do is to expose Russia\u2019s intentions,\u201d Mr. Carpenter said, adding that \u201cunfortunately, we have been more right than wrong in exposing what we believe may be coming next.\u201d", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/world/europe/ukraine.html"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": "36dd19889a6f4842a95315b3b58a22ad", "name": "Lara Jakes"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Russian forces", "weight": 0.07789391}, {"name": "eastern Ukraine", "weight": 0.07389148}, {"name": "Ukraine", "weight": 0.07338188}, {"name": "southern Ukraine", "weight": 0.0732556}, {"name": "Ukrainian forces", "weight": 0.066741414}, {"name": "Russia", "weight": 0.06487681}, {"name": "other human rights abuses", "weight": 0.063247696}, {"name": "other parts", "weight": 0.06123633}, {"name": "other international allies", "weight": 0.06018424}, {"name": "last week", "weight": 0.059369467}], "topics": [{"name": "Europe"}, {"name": "Russia"}, {"name": "Russia-Ukraine War"}, {"name": "Ukraine"}], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "Donetsk People\u2019s Republic", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Mariupol", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "WASHINGTON", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Russia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 9}, {"data": "Ukraine", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "Moscow", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Luhansk", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Kherson", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Crimea", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Kyiv", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Denis Pushilin", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Konstantin Ivashchenko", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Michael Carpenter", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Vladimir V.

With a big assist from Ukraine\u2019s army, of course.\n\nOn Monday, a TB-2 armed drone apparently belonging to the Ukrainian sea service struck two Russian patrol boats with laser-guided missiles, heavily damaging if not destroying both boats.\n\nAdd the two 55-foot, gun-armed Raptor-class vessels to the growing list of Russian boats and ships the Ukrainians have sunk or so heavily damaged that they\u2019re no longer relevant to the current conflict.\n\nMoscow\u2019s naval losses of course include the 612-foot missile cruiser Moskva, holed by two Ukrainian navy Neptune coastal anti-ship missiles on April 13. Moskva was the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet with its, at the time, two dozen or so major warships.\n\nThree weeks earlier on March 24, an Alligator-class landing ship belonging to the Black Sea Fleet\u2019s reinforced amphibious flotilla burst into flames while pier-side in Russian-occupied Berdyansk in southern Ukraine. It seems an accurate hit by a Ukrainian army Tochka ballistic missile started the chain reaction.\n\nThe 370-foot Saratov quickly sank. A pair of landing ships moored nearby also suffered damage and casualties. The attack on the Crimea-based amphibious force was an inflection point in Russia\u2019s wider war on Ukraine, which began with heavy bombardment on the night of Feb. 23.\n\nDown three amphibs as well as Moskva with its long-range air-defense missiles, the Black Sea Fleet no longer can concentrate a large landing force nor protect it from air and missile attack. That means the Russians almost certainly can\u2019t open a littoral front along Ukraine\u2019s western coastline in order to stage an assault on the strategic port of Odessa, Ukraine\u2019s main gateway to the sea.\n\nThat could free up Odessa\u2019s garrison, including the reserve 5th Tank Brigade with its undamaged T-72 battalions, to roll east in support of Ukraine\u2019s campaign around the port of Kherson, occupied by the Russians since early March.\n\nMoskva, Saratov and the other landing ships are the most significant naval casualties on the Russian side, but they\u2019re not the only ones. On or before March 22, Ukrainian army troops in Mariupol\u2014an historic port on the Sea of Azov, adjacent to the Black Sea\u2014struck a Raptor with at least one Konkurs anti-tank missile as the boat patrolled close to shore.\n\nThat makes two big Russian ships sunk plus two damaged, as well as three patrol boats knocked out if not totally destroyed. This out of a regional fleet that, before the war, included just seven large surface combatants\u2014frigates and large corvettes plus Moskva\u2014in addition to a half-dozen landing ships, six or seven Raptors and six or so diesel-electric submarines.\n\nBear in mind, Turkey controls the Bosphorous Strait, the only waterway connecting the Sea of Azov and Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea and thus the open ocean. Ankara is a strong backer of Ukraine\u2019s independence\u2014remember, the TB-2 drone is a Turkish product\u2014and has not allowed the Russian navy to send in fresh ships to make good the Black Sea Fleet\u2019s losses.\n\nAll that is to say, the Black Sea Fleet is getting smaller and less effective by the week as Ukraine\u2019s forces chip away at it. And there\u2019s no prospect of the fleet restoring its waning power until after the war ends ... and Turkey reopens the Bosphorous.\n\nThe TB-2 strike on Monday underscores the Black Sea Fleet\u2019s dire condition. It\u2019s apparent the Russians no longer can protect their remaining warships from aerial attack.\n\nMoskva with her 200-mile air-search radars and 64 S-300 surface-to-air missiles, each with a 50-mile range, in theory was the fleet\u2019s main air-defender. But the cruiser couldn\u2019t even defend herself.\n\nNow the Black Sea Fleet leans on a trio of 409-foot Admiral Grigorovich-class frigates for aerial protection. The frigates are some of the newest vessels in the Russian fleet\u2014and the biggest surface warships Russian industry can build owing to problems manufacturing or importing large maritime engines.\n\nBut the three frigates\u2014Admiral Grigorovich, Admiral Essen and Admiral Makarov\u2014each pack just 24 medium-range Buk surface-to-air missiles traveling no farther than 30 miles. Even with Crimea-based fighter jets and SAM batteries backing them up, the frigates almost certainly are struggling to maintain an air-defense umbrella along the Black Sea Fleet\u2019s area of operations stretching along 300 or 400 miles of coastline from Odessa to Mariupol.\n\nThe Ukrainians have proved they can exploit the gaps in the Russians\u2019 at-sea air-defense coverage.

The actual toll is likely to be \"considerably higher.\" Most were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area such as missiles and air strikes.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s aide, Mykhaylo Podolyak, has called Russia \"the successor to Nazi ideology\" after Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov claimed that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler \"had Jewish blood.\"\n\nMariupol. The evacuation of Ukrainians from the Azovstal steel plant in the port city of Mariupol ran into delays today. The buses carrying evacuated civilians were forced through a number of Russian checkpoints before reaching the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia.\n\nNearly 100 civilians have already been evacuated to Zaporizhzhia. They left Azovstal after sheltering there for 60 days. After evacuees left the plant on Sunday, Russian forces immediately resumed shelling the site, according to the Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nSeveral hundred people, including around 20 children, are still stuck in the basement of the plant awaiting evacuation.\n\nKherson. Several civilians were injured by Russian shelling in the Kherson region, most suffering shrapnel wounds. Russians also damaged several civilian houses and a school with Grad rocket-propelled grenade launchers.\n\nKharkiv. Russians shelled the northeastern city of Kharkiv more than five times during the day: 3 people were killed and 8 civilians were injured.\n\nUkrainian soldiers liberated Ruska Lozova and several other villages in Kharkiv Oblast on Monday, according to Ukraine\u2019s Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar. Their liberation could make it more difficult for Russian forces to launch missile and artillery attacks against the city.\n\nLuhansk. Russian shelling in Luhansk Oblast killed 3 residents and injured 3 others, including a 12-year-old boy.\n\nRussians also destroyed many residential buildings, including a gymnasium in Lysychansk built over 100 years ago. This gymnasium \u2013 one of the top 100 schools in Ukraine \u2013 was a part of the Belgian architectural heritage of the region.\n\nOdesa. A Russian missile strike struck an important bridge across the Dniester estuary in the Odesa region. It was Russia\u2019s third attack on the bridge. It provides the only road and rail link in Ukrainian territory to a large southern section of the Odesa region.\n\nUkraine received \u20ac495 million in grant assistance from the World Bank to provide social, humanitarian, and healthcare support, according to Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Finance.\n\nU.S. First lady Jill Biden will visit Romania and Slovakia to show support for Ukrainian refugees.

It said that western economic sanctions meant Moscow would become increasingly reliant on component-smuggling to ensure its jets, missiles and other hi-tech munitions can function.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph reported that a Whitehall inquiry would be launched to look into UK components being used in Russian weapons systems.\n\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cWe have introduced the largest and most severe economic sanctions that Russia has ever faced, to help cripple Putin\u2019s war machine, including by sanctioning key defence sector organisations, and banning the export of critical technologies.\n\n\u201cThe UK has one of the most robust and transparent export-control regimes in the world.

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nRussian soccer teams and clubs were barred from all European competitions, including the Champions League, for the 2022-23 season.\n\nRussia was ejected from this summer\u2019s European women\u2019s soccer championship and barred from qualifying for the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup on Monday, deepening a sporting isolation that resulted from the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. UEFA, the governing body for soccer in Europe, announced its decisions Monday. In addition to barring Russia\u2019s team from the two biggest competitions in women\u2019s soccer, the governing body said it had suspended all Russian national teams and clubs from UEFA competitions until further notice. Russian clubs were also barred from all UEFA competitions \u2014 including the Champions League, the richest club competition in soccer \u2014 for the 2022-23 season.\n\nThe punishments had previously been applied most prominently to Russian men\u2019s teams, tossing Russia out of qualifying for this year\u2019s World Cup in Qatar when it needed only two more wins to earn a place in the field and ejecting a Russian club, Spartak Moscow, from the knockout rounds of the Europa League.\n\nRussia\u2019s women had missed two World Cup qualifiers in April as a result of the earlier ban on its teams, but UEFA had postponed a decision on its participation at the women\u2019s Euros, which open in July in England. Now, with the event approaching and many countries on record saying they would not play against a Russian team, it was left with little choice. Portugal will replace Russia at the European Championship, taking its place in a group that includes two of the tournament favorites \u2014 the Netherlands and Sweden \u2014 as well as Switzerland. Russia had defeated Portugal in a playoff to qualify for the event. Several international sports leagues and organizations have dropped Russia and Russian athletes from competition since the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February, in sports as varied as tennis, soccer, auto racing and track and field. Last week, Russia was stripped of the hosting rights for next year\u2019s world ice hockey championships. Russia has vowed to fight some of the punishment against its teams and athletes at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland, the body responsible for adjudicating disputes in sports. And not everyone has agreed with blanket bans on Russian athletes.\n\nAfter Wimbledon, under pressure from the British government, confirmed that it would not allow Russian and Belarusian players to participate in the grass-court tennis tournament this summer, the governing bodies for the men\u2019s and women\u2019s tours both expressed concern about the decision. The ATP, which runs the men\u2019s tour, called it \u201cunfair\u201d and said it had \u201cthe potential to set a damaging precedent for the game.\u201d The WTA, which oversees the women\u2019s tour, said: \u201cIndividual athletes should not be penalized or prevented from competing due to where they are from or the decisions made by the governments of their countries. Discrimination, and the decision to focus such discrimination against athletes competing on their own as individuals, is neither fair nor justified.\u201d On Sunday, the top men\u2019s players Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal added their voices to the criticism. \u201cIt\u2019s not their fault what\u2019s happening in this moment with the war,\u201d Nadal, a 21-time Grand Slam winner, said in Spain, calling some of the affected players \u201cmy Russian teammates, my colleagues.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry for them,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cWimbledon just took their decision.

The cuts are so dramatic, and the planned parade so humiliating, that Russia\u2019s President, Vladimir Putin, will likely do almost anything to keep the World from focusing overly much upon Russia\u2019s dwindling military prospects.\n\nAs planned, the 2022 Victory Day military parade through Red Square will be a humiliating exercise for the Russian military. The traditional parade, commemorating the surrender of Nazi Germany in World War II, has always been a place where active Russian leaders flaunted their strength and demonstrated Russia\u2019s military prowess.\n\nThis year, Russia\u2019s slimmed-down Victory Day Parade projects little more than military and economic weakness.\n\nRussia Cannot Hide Their Losses In Ukraine\n\nParade guides show that only 25 Russian ground combat systems will be represented by 131 ground combat vehicles. That might sound like a lot, but, last year, Russia deployed 198 vehicles to display 35 separate systems.\n\nThe shift is marked. In 2015, after Russia annexed Crimea, Russia used the Victory Day Parade to reveal a robust suite of new and seemingly formidable Russian weaponry. But now, after failing to take Ukraine by force, Russia\u2019s military shortcomings will be on full display, strengthening Ukrainian apatite for sustained resistance and a long war of attrition.\n\nThe shrunken parade reflects both battlefield failings and large losses. The usual large contingent of Rosgvardia forces, after being mauled in Ukraine, are absent.\n\nFaced with confirmed losses of at least 600 tanks, Russia\u2019s battered army now seems unable to even muster mainstream armored vehicles\u2014staples of any Russian military parade. After losing at least 114 T-80 tanks of various flavors, Russia\u2019s military is now apparently unable to find ten display-ready T-80 main battle tanks.\n\nReflecting enormous battlefield losses, the number of Russian Infantry Fighting Vehicles participating in the parade was cut by 50%. Only 3 BMP-3 Infantry Fighting Vehicles will parade through Red Square. Artillery and multiple rocket launch systems have mostly disappeared, represented by a single class of 152 mm self-propelled howitzer and an \u201cupdated\u201d version of the old 122mm Grad multiple rocket launcher\u2014a battlefield system that was cutting edge back in the 1960\u2019s.\n\nIn a sorry effort to boost the number of systems on parade, the Russians are even highlighting the lowly tank transporters employed to carry Russia\u2019s poor-performing unmanned ground system, the Uran 9, over the parade route.\n\nEven more interesting is that Russia seems unable to grow the number of advanced weapon systems. After revealing a number of new\u2014and well-hyped\u2014armored vehicles in 2015, Russia\u2019s arms factories have evidently been unable to build parade-ground ready demonstrators.\n\nRussia\u2019s new main battle tank, the T-14 Armata, made a Victory Parade debut in 2015. And, despite all the ambitious talk about how the new tank was out \u201cin the field\u201d and working through production kinks in Syria, Russia somehow only has three examples ready to show in the Red Square parade\u2014the three-tank parade fleet has remained steady for three years now.\n\nOther new systems\u2014armored vehicles that might not be quite ready for battle but certainly should, at this point in their development, be available in sufficient numbers for parade duty\u2014just haven\u2019t grown. Along with the T-14 Armatas, there\u2019s no evidence Russia has been able to build up other critical components of their next-generation armored vehicle fleet.\n\nNext week, Russia is set to display display only three copies of the Kurganets-25 infantry fighting vehicle. First shown in the 2015 Victory Parade, production seems to have frozen. Another example from the 2015 parade, the VPK-7829 Bumerang armored car, is stuck with an unchanging inventory of 3 parade-ready platforms.\n\nIf Russia\u2019s military parades are any guide, the Russian Army\u2019s modernization is little more than an overhyped mirage.\n\nBeyond simply emphasizing the strain Ukraine is placing on Russia\u2019s army, the 2022 Victory Parade suggests that Russia\u2019s armored vehicle production capabilities are crumbling.\n\nThe message sent by Russia\u2019s planned military fly-over is even worse.\n\nAfter losing at least 39 helicopters in Ukraine, Russia can only muster 15 helicopters for parade duty, down from 23 in 2021.\n\nRussia\u2019s fixed-wing aircraft are also facing serious losses over Ukraine. After loosing more than ten modern Sukhoi Su-30 and Su-34 fighter aircraft on the battlefield, none are showing up for the parade. Instead, the Victory Parade overflight seems set to celebrate Russia\u2019s lost military glory, represented by a creaky fleet of Mikoyan Mig-29 fighter jets.\n\nThe shift in attention is stark. After relegating the \u201cFulcrum\u201d to the back benches in prior parades\u2014only 4 Mig-29s passed over Red Square in the last two Victory Day celebrations\u2014Russia is highlighting the old Soviet-era jet in a big way.\n\nThis year, Russia is deploying an incredible 16 Mig-29s\u2014the \u201870\u2019s era war horse will represent more than 25 percent of the fixed-wing aircraft Russia plans to fly over Red Square on May 9.\n\nIn a sad effort to snatch back some of the glory Ukraine\u2019s Air Force has enjoyed with its fleet of cast-off former Soviet Mig-29s, Russia is even sending the old fighters out to conduct a tawdry \u201cZ\u201d pattern fly-by.\n\nIt May Be Victory Day, But Russia is Celebrating Somebody Else\u2019s Victory\n\nPutin must know that he is set to preside over an embarrassment. The May 9 military parade only highlights Russia\u2019s massive losses in Ukraine and emphasizes Russia\u2019s crumbling industrial capabilities. In the air, Russia\u2019s Air Force is resorting to celebrating an iconic Ukrainian platform that is now almost a symbol of resistance to the Putin regime.\n\nThe Russian military knows that this year\u2019s Victory Day parade is a sad and tawdry show, and Putin, if he shows up, will have to sit though it all. It will not be a pleasant experience\u2014and Russia\u2019s military leaders, for their part, may well enjoy watching their boss squirm over his role in the current debacle.\n\nTo distract or deflect from his regime\u2019s role in Russia\u2019s military collapse, Russia\u2019s president and his flunkies will likely lean into anti-semitic actions, apocalyptic rhetoric, or take some other controversial step. Putin, in turn, may use the embarassing parade to castigate military leaders, demanding reform. Or, instead, he may follow Joseph Stalin\u2019s World War II example and use the evident military shortcomings to call for a full national mobilization.\n\nThe May 9 Victory Day Parade is an unavoidable moment of pageantry, putting Russia\u2019s military and Russia\u2019s leadership on a prominent world stage. But the big Red Square show, as it stands now, suggests that, while Russia may be celebrating a victory, things are not going Russia\u2019s way on the current battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nInstigating drama is about the only way the Russian regime can reduce growing awareness that both Russian and Putin\u2019s authority is backed by a Potemkin military\u2014an apparently over-hyped and now largely hollow force.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["http://redstar.ru/poryadok-proezda-mehanizirovannoj-kolonny-9-maya-2022-goda-po-krasnoj-ploshhadi/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/tedreed/2021/09/23/american-airlines-pilots-say-operations-managers-must-go-after-summer-breakdowns/", "https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html", "https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/russian-tv-threatens-underwater-poseidon-nuke-uk/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2021/09/27/the-us-air-force-is-gradually-rebuilding-its-b-52-bombers-from-the-rivets-out/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uran-9", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2021/09/27/an-american-bomber-visited-malaysia-a-bizarre-mix-of-local-jets-rose-to-meet-it/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/craighooper/2022/04/29/with-victory-day-looming-the-west-has-10-days-to-target-putin/?sh=5648e9804261", "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-61296682"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": null, "name": "Craig Hooper"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Russia", "weight": 0.102348454}, {"name": "parade duty", "weight": 0.077455446}, {"name": "parade", "weight": 0.076942705}, {"name": "prior parades", "weight": 0.07466278}, {"name": "Russia\u2019s crumbling industrial capabilities", "weight": 0.07437512}, {"name": "Russia\u2019s military parades", "weight": 0.07300813}, {"name": "Russia\u2019s armored vehicle production capabilities", "weight": 0.07261371}, {"name": "military leaders", "weight": 0.06719537}, {"name": "armored vehicles", "weight": 0.06668174}, {"name": "Victory Day Parade", "weight": 0.06528653}], "topics": [{"name": "Ukraine"}, {"name": "Russia-Ukraine War"}], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "Russia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 42}, {"data": "Germany", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ukraine", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 9}, {"data": "Crimea", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Syria", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Potemkin", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Victory Day Parade", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 11}, {"data": "World War II", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Vladimir Putin", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "Joseph Stalin\u2019s", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Red Square", "type": "FAC", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "Russian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 10}, {"data": "Nazi", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ukrainian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Soviet", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Rosgvardia", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Russian Army\u2019s", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Sukhoi", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Mikoyan", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Air Force", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "T-80", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Infantry Fighting Vehicles", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Grad", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Uran 9", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Kurganets-25", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "VPK-7829 Bumerang", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Su-30", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Mig-29", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Fulcrum", "type": "WORK_OF_ART", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.012041548, "negative": 0.94616336, "neutral": 0.04179511}, "summary": "\n\nIn a sorry effort to boost the number of systems on parade, the Russians are even highlighting the lowly tank transporters employed to carry Russia\u2019s poor-performing unmanned ground system, the Uran 9, over the parade route.\n\nEven more interesting is that Russia seems unable to grow the number of advanced weapon systems. \n\nAfter losing at least 39 helicopters in Ukraine, Russia can only muster 15 helicopters for parade duty, down from 23 in 2021.

Vance has taken off after a rocky start, putting him ahead of Republican competitors Josh Mandel and Mike Gibbons for the coveted spot in Ohio.\n\nThe difference? Trump's endorsement on April 15. A Fox News poll after the endorsement showed about 42% of respondents said it made them more supportive of Vance.\n\nVance also jumped in a Fox News poll from a distant third in the race to the lead after getting the nod from Trump, though about a quarter of voters are undecided.\n\nBut Trump's favoritism hasn't stopped the other candidates from using him in their campaigns.

But others argue it saved the economy.\n\nThe central bank is expected to raise short-term interest rates by double the usual amount when it releases its latest statement on Wednesday. It has already raised its key overnight rate once, the first such increase since 2018, and Wall Street is expecting several big increases over the coming months.\n\nRate hikes from the Fed will further increase borrowing costs across the board for people buying cars, using credit cards and taking out mortgages to buy homes. Investors have been concerned about rising inflation and its impact on businesses and consumers. But, they are also concerned about how the rate hikes will play out in fighting inflation and whether a more aggressive Fed could actually hurt economic growth.\n\nConcerns about rising inflation have also been hanging over the latest round of corporate earnings. Disappointing results or outlooks from Apple, Google\u2019s parent company and Amazon helped fuel the selling last week.

The move was predicated upon the refusal of both countries to pay for their long-contracted gas deliveries in rubles. As payments by other countries near their due dates, many ask whether this is the time when Russia may cut its gas deliveries to Europe completely and, if so, what can the U.S. do? We explored the issue in depth in Send Lawyers, (Gas) & Money: Strategic Response Options if Russia Cuts Gas Supplies to Europe published shortly before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. We and our co-authors concluded there that market forces, together with cogent political leadership, could be sufficient to mount a \u201cGasLift\u201d similar in spirit to the Berlin airlift of 1948-1949 and supply Europe with sufficient natural gas to get through the immediate winter crisis and into a period when policy decisions could be made for the future. Those conclusions have been validated.\n\nYet, some commentators have recently called for more drastic steps, including invoking the Defense Production Act to force US LNG producers to re-direct LNG cargoes to Europe. Such action at this time would, in our view, be counterproductive, harmful to US trade policy, and unnecessary. Indeed, even without any such drastic governmental action, most northern European LNG terminals are already running at over 100% capacity (See Figure 1 below) with Poland currently at 117% capacity. Why should we break a model that is working for both the U.S. and Europe?\n\nYet, some commentators have recently called for more drastic steps, including invoking the Defense Production Act to force US LNGproducers to re-direct LNG cargoes to Europe.

Why should we break a model that is working for both the U.S. and Europe?\n\nFor Poland and Bulgaria, the decision not to accede to Gazprom\u2019s demand to alter their contracts to allow for conversion of their payments into rubles may have been somewhat easier than it would be for other countries. Both countries have been preparing to end their long-term contracts with Russia completely at the end of this year and have been well on the way with ensuring adequate supplies from alternative sources. The wake-up call started in 2021 when Russia began delivering significantly less gas than usual despite higher-than-average European demand. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine only added to the sense of urgency. In fact, Poland\u2019s advance preparation has enabled it to keep its gas storage at extremely high levels; a staggering 76% at the end of the heating season.\n\nA similar decision will be much more difficult for countries such as Germany, Austria, or Italy, which have not made similar adjustments to provide for an immediate alternative to Russian gas. This could be especially problematic in the cases of Germany and Italy, Gazprom\u2019s largest EU customers. Each of them is currently scrambling to ensure possible non-Russian supply from different sources, including installing LNG floating storage and regasification units (FSRU)s by end of this year at their shores and trying to bring in more gas via pipeline from Algeria (in Italy\u2019s case). As discussed in another recent Baker Institute policy brief, A Bridge Over Troubled Water: LNG FSRUs Can Enhance European Energy Security, FSRUs are a valuable asset in meeting energy security needs while maintaining climate policy flexibility. However, since none of these steps would be sufficient to solve an immediate and complete gas cut off by Russia, other resources would need to be involved.\n\nAs we point in Send Lawyers, (Gas) & Money, both LNG markets and immediate practical measures can make potential cutoff of Russian gas manageable in the short term; especially now, at the end of the heating season when natural gas demand drops significantly. And while, on average European gas storage is nowhere close to the Polish levels, it still is at levels that fit within the average at this time of the year (in the 30s%) and could be used to supply gas for immediate needs.\n\nThat being said, storage is supposed to be filled and not emptied at this time of the year and any lack of Russian gas supply will further stress the European system. Since the undelivered Russian gas has nowhere else to go (at least until Russia builds a new pipeline to China), the situation can reverberate globally, hiking up prices as Europe will need to compete for LNG against Asia. Will there be enough LNG and will prices be acceptable for Europe to secure enough gas to prevent inadequate gas supply for next winter? After all, Asian buyers are known for their resolve in filling their storage and did so last summer at the time when European buyers were not willing to pay what they at that time considered high summer prices.\n\nThis is the point where some commentators have suggested that the U.S. should become even more actively involved, forcing US LNG suppliers to divert supplies to Europe. The U.S. government should, they argue, employ the Defense Production Act or other legal means to direct producers of LNG in the U.S. to \u201cbreach\u201d their contracts and deliver LNG cargoes to Europe. While we acknowledge the possibility of direct governmental action in Send Lawyers, (Gas) & Money, , particularly in the event of active war directly involving the United States and NATO, we stress that such actions at this time would be counterproductive, damaging to U.S. trade interests, and wholly unnecessary.\n\nLNG supplies from the U.S. are already inherently flexible; deliveries are typically made at the loading terminal with the customer taking title and control at that terminal on a vessel of the customer\u2019s choosing. Aside from avoiding a handful of sanctioned countries, there are no restrictions on the destination to which the customer may take the cargo, and no requirement that the customer share with the LNG producer any of the higher price the customer may achieve by diverting the cargo. This flexibility resulted in a flood of US cargoes being redirected to Europe this past winter in the run-up to and during the initial invasion of Ukraine without the need for direct action by the U.S. government. Such flexibility in long-term contracts is unusual in the LNG industry, and customers worldwide have been attracted to this feature, helping to make the U.S. the world\u2019s largest LNG exporter. From a political risk perspective, billion-plus dollar investments to secure LNG from the U.S. remain attractive relative to other regions, largely because they are commercially-centered with little government interference. In fact, the U.S. government has never terminated an export license for an operating LNG export project. To force U.S. LNG producers to breach their contracts now would forever tarnish that reputation, and could have a serious and deleterious impact on investment in future LNG projects that would otherwise provide precisely the kind of flexible LNG supply that came to Europe\u2019s rescue just a few months ago.\n\nBeyond being counterproductive and poor trade policy, such an action is also wholly unnecessary. According to Cedigaz data, northern European LNG import terminals \u2013 those in the area most affected by a cutoff of Russian natural gas \u2014 operated on average at over 100% of nameplate capacity in March 2022 (See Figure 1 above). Poland\u2019s terminal operated at 117%. However, LNG terminals in the U.K. operated at only 59% in March. Officials from the U.S. and U.K. governments have reportedly discussed making available LNG supplied to the U.K.to continental Europe, but opportunities to do so in the short term are limited. The U.K. is connected by pipelines to Belgium and the Netherlands that are already in use; combined, their capacity of 3.75 bcm/month adds only 5.5% to the volume of LNG being processed at all northern European LNG terminals on the continent. The U.K. has discussed re-exporting, or even \u201cshuttling\u201d, LNG from its terminals to terminals in Europe, but as shown above those European terminals are already operating well above capacity and new FSRUs are not scheduled to be on station for several months or longer. Even as FSRUs are added, they are likely to bring helpful, but incremental, capacity online, and there is no reason to think that the current system that has brought so much LNG to Europe cannot meet the additional demand that a half-dozen publicly-announced FSRUs will require.\n\nIt is possible that Europe will invest substantially in more onshore and offshore natural gas infrastructure and their LNG demand will grow dramatically beyond its current level. Until then, forcing U.S. LNG producers to redirect more cargoes to Europe begs the question \u2013 if breaking the flexible and reliable U.S. LNG contracting model cannot actually push more LNG into Europe than Europe is able to take, what is the benefit of breaking the model?\n\nHere is where U.S. gas diplomacy can become more important and valuable than regulatory mandates interfering with private contracts. We have seen it already working in 2022 and we are likely to see it again now that the risk of either partial or even complete Russian gas cutoff has become that much greater. Government suasion can and should be directed at many actors, including by Europeans to increase their gas production and purchases from Groningen, Norway and Algeria, arrange for immediate LNG infrastructure buildup through FSRUs, shorten permitting times for all energy infrastructure (including the current seven years for new wind projects), and encourage fuel switching and even involve gas rationing. The U.S. government can work with other LNG producers (like Qatar, Nigeria and Australia) to make their cargos more flexible when it comes to destination and work with large LNG buyers in Asia at ensuring that European gas supply security is retained \u2013 all steps that can make a difference without direct intervention in U.S. gas sales contracts. Such intervention, though possible, should be reserved for very unique circumstances and after exhausting the full extent of all soft power measures available to achieve its goals. Only then should the U.S. consider moving to more direct intervention. We posit that such intervention at this time would be counterproductive to meeting future needs for flexible supply to Europe and elsewhere and damage the U.S. trade relationships. Moreover, the success of the \u201cGasLift\u201d over the last few months has demonstrated that such intervention is not necessary and would be unlikely to bring any incremental benefit to Europe, where terminals are already full with LNG from the U.S. and elsewhere.\n\nAnna Mikulska a nonresident fellow for the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy & senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.\n\nSteven R.

In the early days of the war, families fled. The thud of artillery echoed through the streets. Countless sandbag checkpoints went up. And looming over the city was the prospect of fighting in the streets or a drawn-out siege.\n\nNow, a month after the Ukrainian Army defeated the Russian forces that had partly encircled Kyiv, the city is enjoying a return to something like normalcy. For most of April, more residents returned to the capital than left, though the mayor has recommended that most families refrain from returning while threats from the ongoing war linger. The prewar population of the metropolitan area of Kyiv was about four million; it dropped by half over a few hectic days in February. Despite some families returning, many people with children remain in western Ukraine or as refugees in Europe, facing an uncertain future. Back in March, Honey Caf\u00e9, a cozy bakery and coffee shop on Yaroslaviv Val Street that for unclear reasons reopened for business quickly, seemed the only spot in town to sit down for coffee. Even so, waiters warned, \u201cDon\u2019t sit near the windows,\u201d lest an explosion spray glass shards. Today, sidewalk cafes are popping up throughout Kyiv. Some restaurants are packed again, the once usual, if unwelcome, state of affairs. At Tin Tin Food Spot, a restaurant beside the city\u2019s bicycle racing track, a lunchtime crowd filled every seat on Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe mood of the residents is one of deep gratefulness: that the city is still standing, that life can resume. It has made for a general sense of bonhomie. On a recent hourslong walk, meandering through the cobblestone back streets of the Golden Gate and Podil neighborhoods, passers-by smiled or nodded pleasantly. The chestnut trees were in bloom. And from time to time, on the crests of hills, the city\u2019s still-intact skyline of golden church cupolas and high-rise buildings came into view.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/05/02/world/ukraine-russia-war-news/britain-says-that-1-in-4-russian-invasion-units-is-now-combat-ineffective?smid=url-copy&action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-russia-ukraine&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/14/world/europe/european-union-oil-embargo-russia-ukraine.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-russia-ukraine&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/28/us/politics/ukraine-biden-aid.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-russia-ukraine&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/01/world/europe/russian-general-dead-valery-gerasimov.html?smid=url-copy&action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-russia-ukraine&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/05/02/world/ukraine-russia-war-news?smid=url-copy&action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-russia-ukraine&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc#escaping-mariupol-one-resident-said-that-those-left-behind-were-gripped-with-hopelessness", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/29/world/europe/civilians-mariupol-azovstal.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-russia-ukraine&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/01/world/europe/pelosi-kyiv-ukraine.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-russia-ukraine&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/05/02/world/ukraine-russia-war-news/pelosi-russia-ukraine-military?smid=url-copy&action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-russia-ukraine&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/05/02/world/ukraine-russia-war-news/here-are-the-latest-developments-in-the-war-in-ukraine?smid=url-copy&action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-russia-ukraine&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": null, "name": "Andrew E.

Additionally, American firms may need to acquire a stack of rubles to pay for their own inputs for foreign-based factories, warehouses, or raw materials.\n\nBy tying the ruble to gold, Russia pushes to make its currency independent of comparisons to the U.S. dollar. Requiring countries to buy its desired major exports with the ruble is an attempt to create an alternative global financial path and also to increase the amount of gold it holds.\n\nOverall, the move is clever geopolitical PR \u201cshowing Russia is a major political, showing that [Putin] can make western leaders vulnerable politically,\u201d said Andrei Korobkov, professor and director of Russian studies in the political science and international relations department at Middle Tennessee State University. \u201cIt\u2019s sending [other countries] a signal that it\u2019s time to start destroying western monopoly and the financial strength of the dollar.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s move, like a forced error in baseball, was set in motion by the actions of the Biden administration and other western powers in responding to that country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Even though Russia\u2019s debt to GDP ratio is a very low number \u2014 about 18% according to analytics consultancy World Economics \u2014 the country is close to default on two different dollar-based bonds because the U.S. has blocked Russia\u2019s access to its U.S. dollar holdings. Then, Russia tried to pay in rubles. No dice. So Russia needed to find another source of dollars to pay its bond holders. Receiving gold for its rubles (which will, in turn, be used to purchase oil and other energy and fertilizer products), gives Moscow gold to trade for dollars in international markets and thereby pay its bond holders.\n\nRussia isn\u2019t alone in its desire. \u201cChina has been explicit\u201d in its desire to displace the dollar and make the yuan more central, Mitchell said.\n\n\u201cThe biggest one of anyone trying to displace the dollar is that it\u2019s terribly convenient when everyone uses the same currency,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cIt complicates things if you have people who want to make payments or receive this currency or that currency. The second issue related to that is if you\u2019re going to hold a currency that isn\u2019t your currency, you want a currency that\u2019s widely usable and that a lot of people want. Because of capital controls in China, the yuan hasn\u2019t been able to satisfy that condition to the same degree.\u201d Although China has reduced support for the yuan, Mitchell said, it still artificially suppresses the currency\u2019s value compared to others so the country can more easily export.\n\nChina is taking preliminary measures to defend their state-owned assets against financial sanctions similar to those the U.S. launched against Russia. Regulators from China\u2019s central bank met with domestic and foreign banks to discuss protecting its overseas against possible U.S.-led sanctions, which could be triggered if China were to exert military force against Tawian, a vulnerable island that China considers its territory.\n\nGet ready for a new round of attempts by Russia and China to displace the U.S. dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency\u2014the trusted default for financial transactions everywhere.\n\nThe desire to supplant the U.S. dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency is not new. \u201cHistorically the European Union wanted to do this,\u201d said Christopher Mitchell, assistant professor of politics and international relations at Mt. Holyoke College. \u201cI think there\u2019s a global sense that the euro isn\u2019t ready for that role until the EU supports it with a fiscal and political union. As long as they have these existential questions even as Europeans want to make a bid for it, there are too many questions about the EU and the Eurozone.\u201d\n\nToday, virtually all international transactions occur in U.S. dollars \u2013 everything from agriculture and ammunition to credit cards and oil barrels. This gives the United States some unique advantages: its national debt is denominated in its own currency and it\u2019s generally cheaper to borrow in greenbacks than in rubles or yuan. If the dollar lost its special status as the \u201cworld\u2019s reserve currency,\u201d the price of its imports would rise and the price of its exports would fall. And Americans would be forced to export in order to earn foreign currencies to pay its national debt, which has already topped $30 trillion.\n\n\u201cIf you like fishing, if you like being on boats, you need that lighthouse, you need that safe harbor,\u201d said Giacomo Santangelo, a senior lecturer of economics at Fordham University. Not just in case of danger, but for an overall orientation and orderly operation. \u201cThe reserve currency is that safe harbor [providing] stabilization of trade and currency markets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe stronger a nation\u2019s currency, the cheaper imports are going to be from other countries,\u201d Santangelo said. \u201cTheir currency goes further in the world market.\u201d Companies and individuals see their purchasing power go further. The country can also borrow at lower interest rates, which is critical for the U.S. given its penchant for national debt financing.\n\nNeither Russia nor China, nor even the EU, is yet in a position to displace the supremacy of the dollar. Still, a series of unfortunate events could quickly dethrone king dollar.\n\n\u201cThe dominant role of a global currency is on a tipping point model,\u201d say Mitchell, who points to a time when the British pound served in the role until the 1950s, when the country was perceived as \u201ctoo weak to support a dominant currency.\u201d The British pound never recovered its global role.\n\nThere wouldn\u2019t be a slow transition, more an \u201caccumulation of dissatisfactions with the current order that don\u2019t manifest in change until they suddenly do,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cCertainly, China and Russia and some other countries would love to displace the dollar\u2019s central role. That was one of the big dangers of the US engaging in central bank sanctions [on Russia]. There are little pushes toward actors becoming less comfortable with the central role of the dollar.\u201d", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2021/09/27/5-cognitive-biases-blocking-your-success/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2021/09/22/immigrants-hope-registry-saves-immigration-bill/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelperegrine/2021/09/15/preparing-to-go-public-an-overview-of-the-ipo-process/"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "U.S. dollars", "weight": 0.09826475}, {"name": "foreign currencies", "weight": 0.08369377}, {"name": "dollars", "weight": 0.079912774}, {"name": "king dollar", "weight": 0.07731744}, {"name": "U.S.", "weight": 0.06690967}, {"name": "U.S. companies", "weight": 0.06632829}, {"name": "other countries", "weight": 0.06533121}, {"name": "Russia", "weight": 0.06306494}, {"name": "central bank sanctions", "weight": 0.06272454}, {"name": "rubles", "weight": 0.062047623}], "topics": [{"name": "Russia"}, {"name": "Russia-Ukraine War"}], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "U.S.", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 14}, {"data": "EU", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Russia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 16}, {"data": "Chicago", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ukraine", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Moscow", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "China", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 10}, {"data": "Tawian", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the United States", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Russians", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "American", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Europeans", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "British", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Jack Bouroudjian", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Putin", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Andrei Korobkov", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Biden", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Mitchell", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "Giacomo Santangelo", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Commerce Bank", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Global Smart Commodity Group", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Middle Tennessee State University", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "World Economics", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Mt.

REUTERS/Evgenia Novozhenina\n\n(Reuters) - A U.S. judge will allow a law firm to stop representing Russia's VTB Bank in a lawsuit over the downing of a passenger flight over Ukraine, but warned the bank to quickly hire new attorneys or risk being in default.\n\nA team at Latham & Watkins has been defending VTB, one of Russia\u2019s largest banks, in the Manhattan federal case since 2019. The family of Quinn Schansman, an American killed in the downing of a Malaysia Airlines flight over eastern Ukraine in 2014, says VTB and fellow Russian lender Sberbank funneled money to Russian separatists accused of shooting down the plane. The banks have denied the claims and last year lost a bid to toss out the case on jurisdictional grounds.\n\nMagistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein said Monday that the Latham attorneys can exit the case next month if they provide a sworn statement that includes contact information for the VTB representatives they worked with on the case.\n\nGorenstein also directed VTB to have a new lawyer enter the case by June 2 or risk being in default.\n\nJudges can issue default judgments against defendants that do not take any action in court, and Gorenstein noted that corporations cannot appear in court without a lawyer.\n\nAn attorney with Latham did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nVTB's team at Latham last month moved to withdraw from the litigation, stating that it is ending relationship with the bank \"on multiple matters\" after VTB was sanctioned over the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSchansman's family, represented by attorneys at law firm Jenner & Block, later claimed in a letter to the court that VTB was \u201cexploiting\u201d Latham's plan to exit the case to avoid handing over documents. A Jenner spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday's ruling.\n\nLatham is one of several U.S. law firms cutting ties with Russian clients after the start of the war in Ukraine and the sanctions that followed. Attorneys representing Sberbank in the Schansman case have also told the court that they are planning to exit but have not formally asked to do so.\n\nSince the Russian invasion of Ukraine, other U.S. judges have denied bids by lawyers for Russian parties to halt cases so new attorneys can take over.\n\nThe case is Schansman v.

The money raised will be used to help the Ukrainian army and war-affected cities. Ukrayina.pl spoke to a woman whose photo circulated around the world in the first days of the war.\n\nOlena Kurylo's photo circulated the world media in the first days of the war in Ukraine- AZ\n\nOlena Kurylo, 52, comes from Pervomaisky in the Kharkiv region. For the past five years she has lived with her husband in Chuhuyev (also in the Kharkiv region). She is a choreographer by profession, she worked in this profession for 25 years, and recently she was a teacher in a kindergarten.\n\n\"Lord, I am not ready to die yet\".\n\n- On 24 February at 5:15 we woke up in Chuhuyev due to the noise caused by two distant explosions. At 5:50 the sounds and explosions were already different, much stronger. Since our house is located near the Chuyuyev military airport, we assumed that the explosions could be right there,\" the woman says.\n\nOlena Kurylo's husband went to the petrol station to get some petrol. In the meantime the woman collected documents and other things in order to leave Chuhuyev for a nearby village after her husband's return.\n\n- I remember sitting on the sofa in our small bedroom for a while. I was already ready to leave - says Olena. - Suddenly there was an explosion. I can still see it in my mind's eye. Many small pieces of glass were flying at me. There was only one thought in my head: 'Lord, I am not ready to die yet!' Then a heartbreaking silence fell. After twenty seconds, the neighbours started screaming,\" she adds.\n\nThe woman recalls that her face was bloody and shrapnel wounds were everywhere: on her forehead, cheek, under her eye....\n\nOlena Kurylo, a teacher from Chuhuyev, was seriously injured during Russia's attack on Ukraine- Private archive of Olena Kurylo\n\n- I did not feel any pain, my body seemed numb - says Olena. - I started to grab clothes to put on the wound and somehow stop the bleeding. But blood was flooding my eyes. I couldn't see anything,\" she adds.\n\nOlena's neighbours helped her to stop the bleeding. - I thought it was a nightmare, that I would wake up soon and everything would be fine. But this did not happen,\" the woman says.\n\nDestruction in Olena Kurylo's flat after the Russian army attack - Private archive of Olena Kurylo\n\n- Nikolai usually parks his car 20 metres from where the explosion occurred. But luckily he punctured a tyre just after refuelling. He stopped to change the wheel. That saved his life,\" he adds.\n\nOlena says she found it very difficult to breathe inside the room, so she went outside. On the ground lay the body of a teenage boy who had died when the explosion occurred. The surviving neighbours ran out of the house, got into cars with broken windows and fled as quickly as possible.\n\nAmbulance rescuers gave the woman first aid. It was at this point that foreign journalists took the famous photograph, from which they later painted a portrait and sold it at auction. - I did not want such fame for myself. It would have been better if I was just healthy, next to my husband,\" says Olena.\n\nDoctors later examined the woman thoroughly and diagnosed her with a concussion. She could not see out of her right eye and her face was full of deep wounds.\n\n- When I undressed in the evening, I saw that my back and shoulders were covered in numerous wounds. And in the morning my face became blue-green,\" the woman recalls.\n\nDestruction in Olena Kurylo's flat after the Russian army attack - Private archive of Olena Kurylo\n\n\"The most important thing is that I am alive\".\n\n- On 18 March I managed to get to the Kharkiv station, from there I went to the Dnieper, where my daughter was already there,\" Olena recalls. Her husband remained in Chuhuyev. In Dnepr, doctors told Olena that the retina of her right eye was torn. The woman was advised to go abroad for treatment. She went to a clinic in Poland free of charge thanks to philanthropists.\n\nOlena Kurylo left the hospital. She is beginning to see silhouettes of people in her right eye. The woman will have a second operation at the end of June. After that it will become clear whether Olena will regain her sight 100 per cent.\n\n- I have several scars on my face. Therefore, I will no longer be as beautiful as I was.

David Arakhamia/Azov Regiment/Handout via REUTERS\n\nKYIV, May 2 (Reuters) - A Ukrainian fighter holed up the city of Mariupol said on Monday that up to 200 civilians remained trapped inside bunkers in the Azovstal steel works after an evacuation operation led by the United Nations to save civilians from the site.\n\nCaptain Sviatoslav Palamar, 39, a deputy commander of Ukraine's Azov Regiment, told Reuters that his fighters could hear the voices of people trapped in bunkers of the vast industrial complex.\n\nHe said they were women, children and elderly people, but that the Ukrainian forces there did not have the mechanised equipment needed to dislodge the rubble, he said.\n\nReuters was unable to independently verify his comments.\n\n\"We were planning to tear up the bunkers, the entrance to which is blocked, but all night into Monday naval artillery and barrel artillery were firing. All day today aviation has been working, dropping bombs,\" Palamar said by Zoom.\n\nAn unknown number of civilians and Ukrainian forces have been holed up in the Azovstal steel works in the port city of Mariupol that has been devastated by weeks of Russian shelling and where Moscow has claimed control.\n\nThe southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol is vitally important to Russia's push to secure a land corridor through to the peninsula of Crimea that Moscow annexed from Kyiv in 2014.\n\nSome groups of civilians left Azovstal over the weekend in an evacuation organised by the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross, the first to leave since President Vladimir Putin ordered the plant barricaded.\n\nDespite that effort, there is no indication of a plan to pull out the Ukrainian forces holed up at Azovstal. These are thought to include members of the Azov regiment, the national guard, marines, border guards and other units.\n\nPalamar said he hoped that other countries would act as guarantors in a deal to provide the troops there with safe passage out of the steel works.\n\n\"This situation that has now developed in Mariupol at the Azovstal plant is a great burden for the president and a great responsibility for him,\" he said, referring to Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who is in Kyiv.\n\n\"As commander-in-chief and as president, he (Zelenskiy) is responsible not only for the civilians who are left here, but he is also responsible for the military, responsible for those wounded soldiers who are dying here, who need emergency medical care, they need medicine, they need surgery,\" he said.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": null, "name": "Margaryta Chornokondratenko"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Azovstal", "weight": 0.066372864}, {"name": "Kyiv", "weight": 0.06528661}, {"name": "civilians", "weight": 0.064515}, {"name": "Ukrainian forces", "weight": 0.0639344}, {"name": "barrel artillery", "weight": 0.06270952}, {"name": "Mariupol", "weight": 0.062354438}, {"name": "naval artillery", "weight": 0.059903987}, {"name": "the sprawling Azovstal steel plant", "weight": 0.059072405}, {"name": "Reuters", "weight": 0.058285397}, {"name": "the Azovstal steel works", "weight": 0.057189144}], "topics": [{"name": "Ukraine"}, {"name": "Russia-Ukraine War"}], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "Azov regiment", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "UN", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "REUTERS", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "the United Nations", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Palamar", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "marines", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Azovstal", "type": "FAC", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Russia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Mariupol", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Ukraine", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "KYIV", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Azovstal", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Moscow", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Crimea", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "David Arakhamia", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Sviatoslav Palamar", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Vladimir Putin", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Volodymyr Zelenskiy", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Ukrainian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Russian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "all night", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Zoom", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.018065272, "negative": 0.81409574, "neutral": 0.16783893}, "summary": "Azov regiment members walk with civilians during UN-led evacuations from the sprawling Azovstal steel plant, after nearly two months of siege warfare on the city by Russia during its invasion, in Mariupol, Ukraine in this still image from handout video released May 1, 2022.

However, many onlookers have used social media to condemn Monday evening\u2019s event for its extravagance and luxury as the nation grapples with a shrinking economy.\n\nAs \u201cGilded Glamour and White Tie\u201d pays homage to the period of rapid prosperity, industrialization and growth in the US from 1870 to 1890, some have called it \u201cout of touch\u201d.\n\nOne user tweeted: \u201cAm I the only one who thinks this years #MetGala theme is out of touch? inequality is at the highest levels since the Gilded Age, a pandemic & economic meltdown wrecked us, inflation is out of control \u2026 but cool, let\u2019s wear #GildedAge themed dresses & laugh about inequality \u2026 this year\u2019s theme is a slap in the face to average Americans.\u201d\n\nAnother user pointed out the irony of such a theme amid the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, writing: \u201cGilded glamor at a time of war, let them eat cake,\u201d referencing a quote commonly attributed to the French queen Marie Antoinette, who during the French Revolution allegedly suggested that starving peasants lacking bread could eat cake.\n\nLast quarter, the American economy shrank for the first time since the recession that struck during the pandemic two years ago. US GDP fell by about 0.35% from January to March, or at an annualized rate of 1.4%, prompting experts to point to rising inflation, the Omicron variant and supply chain issues as factors.\n\nThe rising inflation and economic contraction suggests America\u2019s economy is at a greater risk of a downturn, especially as Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine continues to pummel the global economy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too-on-the-nose for the Met Gala to have a \u2018Gilded Age\u2019 theme on the same day we know the US economy is contracting,\u201d a Business Insider reporter tweeted.\n\n\u201cThe met gala this year is going to piss off people. The theme being gilded glamour??? And with everything going on this year yeah people will be mad lol,\u201d another user tweeted.\n\nEach year, the gala draws out the rich and powerful to raise money for the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute, which is the only department at the museum that is required to raise its own funds.\n\nThe cost for a seat at last year\u2019s gala started at $35,000, although some guests on the highly selective guest list are invited free of charge. The event, which is the institute\u2019s primary source of income, raised more than $16.4m last year.\n\nLast year\u2019s gala also spurred controversy, as the Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wore a white gown that said \u201cTax the Rich\u201d. The dress sparked backlash across the political spectrum, with critics condemning the move as both hypocritical and performative.\n\nOcasio-Cortez defended her actions, saying: \u201cThe medium is the message.\u201d", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://twitter.com/KelseaMariePym/status/1520484304538587136?s=20&t=IGrqCkACX95fYUNHg6cUeQ", "https://twitter.com/TAEHYONCE_/status/1504508136165625856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1504508136165625856%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitframe.com%2Fshow%3Fhttps%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FTAEHYONCE_%2Fstatus%2F1504508136165625856%3Fref_src%3Dtwsrc5Etfw7Ctwcamp5Etweetembed7Ctwterm5E15045081361656258567Ctwgr5E7Ctwcon5Es1_ref_url%3Dhttps3A2F2Felle.mx2Fmoda2F20222F032F172Fcalifican-tematica-met-gala-2022-insensible", "https://twitter.com/bryanboy/status/1504450141528416266?s=20&t=aHEBC-U2Fxwql8tSfWSvRw", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/14/aoc-defends-tax-the-rich-dress-met-gala", "https://twitter.com/JayShams/status/1519660215762886659?s=20&t=aHEBC-U2Fxwql8tSfWSvRw", "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/01/anna-wintour-is-still-queen-of-fashion-but-glitz-wont-reign-at-her-met-gala"], "labels": [{"name": "Pop Culture"}], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": null, "name": "Maya Yang"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "last year", "weight": 0.078923166}, {"name": "year", "weight": 0.06836737}, {"name": "years", "weight": 0.06836737}, {"name": "American fashion", "weight": 0.05848045}, {"name": "rising inflation", "weight": 0.057172935}, {"name": "Last quarter", "weight": 0.05591308}, {"name": "average Americans", "weight": 0.05560901}, {"name": "most Americans", "weight": 0.0549862}, {"name": "#GildedAge themed dresses", "weight": 0.054130763}, {"name": "this years #MetGala theme", "weight": 0.05279049}], "topics": [{"name": "Fashion"}, {"name": "Style"}, {"name": "Inflation"}], "categories": [{"name": "Lifestyle"}], "entities": [{"data": "Met Gala", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "the French Revolution", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Gilded Glamor and White Tie", "type": "WORK_OF_ART", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "In America: An Anthology of Fashion", "type": "WORK_OF_ART", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Tax the Rich", "type": "WORK_OF_ART", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Americans", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Russian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "French", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Democratic", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Andrew Bolton", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Marie Antoinette", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "evening", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "US", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Ukraine", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "America", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Omicron", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Business Insider", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Costume Institute", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.013732064, "negative": 0.9394169, "neutral": 0.046851043}, "summary": "\n\nThe annual gala\u2019s sartorial theme follows the second part of curator Andrew Bolton\u2019s two-part exhibition In America: An Anthology of Fashion, which explores the origins of American fashion.

They are expected to arrive in Zaporizhzhia, about 140 miles northwest of the city.\n\nThe operation to remove the civilians is being coordinated by the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. It comes after the plant has suffered weeks of attacks by Russian forces, killing an unknown number of people and wounding at least 600. The wounded were being attended to by a small medical staff, with some victims reportedly suffering from gangrene and other life-threatening conditions because of the inability to provide advanced medical care.\n\nUNITED NATIONS LOOK TO EVACUATE UKRAINIANS FROM MARIUPOL\n\nFox News has obtained video taken by the Azov Battalion that shows the families holed up together in cramped rooms, bedding and clothes strewn throughout the basement amid the rubble. They're begging for help.\n\n\"We just don\u2019t understand, what is the whole world doing?\" one woman pled. \"Are they just watching as Mariupol is being murdered and crucified?\"\n\nAnother looked into the camera and emotionally said, \"I'm begging everyone please help us, help us to escape,\" before she broke down in tears.\n\nAnother woman noted that because of the Russian attacks, they have not emerged above ground since entering the complex in February. She imagined hearing \"birds sing.\"\n\nThe videos showed squalid living conditions, where the trapped people lived in the underground bunkers that were built to protect the plant's workers from a possible nuclear attack. The complex is built six stories beneath the earth. Mariupol Mayor Vadim Boychenko called the conditions \"worse than hell.\"\n\n\"The Russians do make war on innocent people. That is a military objective they have assigned to their commanders, and it is absolutely outrageous,\" retired four-star U.S. Army Gen. Jack Keane, former vice chairman of the Army and chairman of the Institute for the Study of War, told Fox News.\n\nThere are also fears that the Russian forces will capture and kill the 1,000 or more Ukrainian fighters once the civilians are evacuated.\n\n\"The Russians, if they attempt to get out, will kill them,\" Keane said\n\nHe predicted that the carnage in Mariupol will be revealed to be \"in a scale in the tens of thousands\" and the world will be further exposed to the genocide committed by Vladimir Putin.\n\nBoychenko said that in the last two months, Putin has killed double the number of his city's citizens than Adolf Hitler in a two-year period during World War II.\n\n\"In two years, the Nazis killed 10,000 civilians in Mariupol. The Russian occupiers killed more than 20,000 residents of Mariupol within two months. More than 40,000 people were forcibly deported ... this is one of the worst genocides of civilians in modern history,\" Boychenko said on Telegram this past weekend.\n\nKeane said President Biden must boycott the upcoming G-20 Summit in Indonesia that Putin is expected to attend. \"There is no going back to any kind of normal relationship with Putin, post Ukrainian war, given what he has done.\"\n\nThe New York-based humanitarian group Razom For Ukraine says the killing of civilians in Mariupol shows that \"this is not just a Russian military operation, but a planned genocide of the Ukrainian people.\"\n\nRazom has been raising funds to provide medical and humanitarian supplies and has established the social media campaign to #armukrainenow. The group says Putin's plan is to simply eradicate the Ukrainian people, and that the war strategy on display in Mariupol and the steel plant exposes his human rights abuses and war crimes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The war crimes will continue,\" Razom For Ukraine warned. \"Let's defend freedom and save lives.\"\n\nThose interested in more information can contact RazomforUkraine.org.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/vladimir-putin", "https://www.foxnews.com/world/united-nations-looks-evacuate-ukrainians-mariupol", "https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden", "https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink", "https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia", "https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/defense/wars", "http://video.foxnews.com/v/6304878316001", "http://video.foxnews.com/v/6305485523112", "http://video.foxnews.com/v/6305519564112", "https://www.foxnews.com/world/pope-says-mariupol-barbarously-bombarded-implicitly-criticizing-russia", "https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": "ca7f26a0fb6c405490c4a498b2fe71f4", "name": "Eric Shawn"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Russian attacks", "weight": 0.080030926}, {"name": "post Ukrainian war", "weight": 0.072584726}, {"name": "war crimes", "weight": 0.06761419}, {"name": "Vladimir Putin", "weight": 0.06466454}, {"name": "attacks", "weight": 0.06337208}, {"name": "Fox News", "weight": 0.063174486}, {"name": "advanced medical care", "weight": 0.06306173}, {"name": "Mariupol Mayor Vadim Boychenko", "weight": 0.06295615}, {"name": "innocent people", "weight": 0.06280171}, {"name": "Russian forces", "weight": 0.0625691}], "topics": [{"name": "Ukraine"}, {"name": "Russia-Ukraine War"}], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "Azovstal Steel Works", "type": "FAC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Mariupol", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 9}, {"data": "Ukraine", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Zaporizhzhia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Indonesia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "New York", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Russian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 8}, {"data": "UKRAINIANS", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Nazis", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the United Nations", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Fox News", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "the Azov Battalion", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "U.S. Army", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Telegram", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Razom For Ukraine", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Vadim Boychenko", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Jack Keane", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Vladimir Putin", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Adolf Hitler", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Biden", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "World War II", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "G-20 Summit", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.013664777, "negative": 0.879733, "neutral": 0.10660217}, "summary": "The first 100 of roughly 1,000 civilians, mostly women and children, have been evacuated from the sprawling plant where the citizens have been hiding out from Russian attacks since the war started two months ago.

You only have to look back at historic campaigns involving Russia and its satellites to see that one of its major tactics is to keep throwing men (and women) into battle until the other side runs out of steam.\n\nA comparison of the allied (British, American and French) cemeteries from the second world war in what was West Berlin and the Soviet war memorial in Treptow Park in the erstwhile East Berlin shows the difference in attitude to the value of human life: on the one hand individual graves lovingly cared for, each with its cross; on the other a vast arena where a statue of a Russian soldier holds aloft a child and stamps on the symbol of Nazism, while looking across to the statue of Mother Russia. Between them lie anonymous sarcophagi, each containing an unnumbered quantity of unnamed bodies.\n\nWestern rhetoric will not deter Vladimir Putin, who is a past master of the art; our politicians must find an effective brake to his ambitions in order to prevent further aggression from him.\n\nAnne Maclennan \n\nCuguen, France\n\nI was relieved to read your editorial (29 April) explicitly addressing the risks of escalation of the Ukraine war. I have been alarmed at the increasingly bellicose rhetoric of our government, politicians and commentators in the press, which has drifted towards war between Nato and Russia, without any reflection on the risks raised by a conflict between nuclear powers.\n\nAs someone who lived through much of the cold war, I am astonished and terrified by the apparent lack of concern over the risks of this crisis; where alarm bells should be ringing loudly, nuclear escalation is hardly referred to, despite nuclear Armageddon being a predictable consequence. Whereas the priority should be seeking a negotiated end to the conflict involving unpalatable compromises, all the rhetoric has been of victory and defeat. Unless this changes, the risks will only steadily increase. \n\nStephen Smith\n\nGlasgow\n\nAnother brilliant piece by Simon Jenkins (Liz Truss risks recklessly inflaming Ukraine\u2019s war to serve her own ambition, 28 April). With a prime minister who thinks he\u2019s Winston Churchill and a foreign secretary who thinks she\u2019s Margaret Thatcher, we are at risk of bellicose fantasy sliding into bloody reality. Putin is dangerous, but the best response to danger is rationality, not grandiose promises. Putin needs a way out. A joint undertaking by Russia and Nato to guarantee the neutrality of Ukraine (and other nations) should have been on the table to avert the invasion, but it could still be a way of offering Putin a basis for peace. He would no doubt claim it was an achievement of his demonstration of strength, but sustaining sovereignty would be the real benefit. The endgame has to be agreement, not mutually assured destruction. \n\nAndrew Seber\n\nWinchester\n\nNeal Ascherson\u2019s condemnation of Liz Truss\u2019s dangerous rhetoric is clear and welcome (Letters, 28 April). It is founded on deep understanding of the countries and peoples who live near or around the Black Sea. His call for Truss to be put \u201cback into her cage\u201d should be extended to Boris Johnson and Ben Wallace, who dangerously talk up conflict as a solution and themselves as \u201cleaders\u201d.\n\nDarra McFadyen\n\nLondon\n\nMany international lawyers argue that Nato is an illegal organisation since it is a political and military alliance, not exclusively focused on peace and security, although it signed up to article 2(4) of the UN charter prohibiting use of force to resolve disputes.

That' with Narendra Modi in Berlin and Berlin talking about potentially ending purchases of Russian oil that India may end up picking up those cargoes. How do you think it's going to work if Europe was able to ban Russian crude. Where do you think that crude would ultimately end up. Well we're already seeing guys that is heading towards India. And so you know as soon as there was the invasion of Ukraine we saw India picking up some barrels. So we saw a couple of million going in in March. We saw seven and a half million barrels going in in April. Now we've got 23 million barrels looking to Prague in May. So it's clear that India is picking up these deeply discounted barrels now going forward. There's the talk of this deal being done where they could pick up around half a million barrels a day over the next six months starting in June. So they're going to be one of the leading beneficiaries recipients of any type of thing going on. And you're already seeing certain European countries pivoting away from Russian crude as that happens. You're seeing others finding opportunity there. So India is at the forefront of that. We've also seen a bit of a pick up going into Turkey as well. The one emission that we have seen is that we're not seeing a real strong pickup into China yet but that may be more related to the demand side issues that they're facing in terms of lockdowns. It may also be waiting for a bigger discount for those euros before they start taking them up. Either way India and China look like the big biggest beneficiaries going forward here. Now how does this ultimately all balance out in price where you've got all these moving parts. India may be buying more Russian oil but Europe considering an outright ban on oil. Obviously U.S. producer is a little bit reticent to ramp up the oil production machine. How do you see price headed over the next 12 months. Well sure that the big concern for price is going forward is just a potential recessionary environment as we move into next year. You know just because of inflationary concerns et cetera. But in terms of demand and supply aside from the issues we've had with China on the demand side with lockdowns that's us where the market has been fairly well supported. Right. The one thing we do have coming through in the next few months is from the US side of things. Even if we don't see a real rapid pickup in production we are seeing that of seeking higher. But there is that double whammy that coming through from that SPDR release 180 million barrels potentially hitting the mark over the next six months. That's looking to backfill the potential loss of Russian production which is surely going to happen should we see some type of embargo. Because India and China are unlikely to be able to pick up all of the lot of that for you that would otherwise be going into Europe. So with that said you know price is not to be around. It's kind of hundred dollar mark potentially higher here depending on supply losses going forward. Mark let me just ask you a hypothetical question but I think it's relevant here. The Indian refinery bought some Russian crude at a discount refined back crude into diesel and sold that diesel to Europe with that diesel be Indian crude or Russian crude. That would be considered. There's just no way for it to be able to be declared as as Russian crude being turned into Russian diesel. So it's essentially not an issue because you know Fringe is bringing in about five million barrels a day. So the amount of Russian crude that is bringing in is fairly small. It relies on the Middle East the sort of two thirds of its crude imports. And so you've got all these different types of crude from West Africa from Latin America from Canada and the US going into Indian refineries being blended being refined and then export it out. And so there's just no way to follow it along the supply chain to be able to say oh this isn't you know the engine that produced guarantee that diesel or that is absolute rubbish. And there's just no way to track that unfortunately. How do you see the Saudis reacting to all this movement and deal making in the oil landscape. Being as they are being very quiet you know. You know they've kept quiet in terms of any type of commentary on this. And that should be the view we should expect going forward here you know. Okay. Plus he's looking to continue to put more production back onto the market as demand rebounds. You know they're not likely to be there in a reliable relationship with Russia. And so they're unlikely to to to go against them. So we should expect to hear not only Saudi but the other core members of OPEC being pretty silent on this matter. I was just staying sidelines. Does Russian crew continue to trade at a discount or as we start figuring out ways that it can be sold to India or China or whoever ultimately it ends up being sold to that discount disappears. We still see that euros discounted about thirty one dollars. So it's been kind of in that region since the invasion. And so there is just this expectation we should see it around that level continuing here as we get sanju embargos coming through from Europe. We should see that discount blow out even further as more barrels become available and need to price to be able to find a home elsewhere. And so we should expect that discount just for the euros amount coming out the Baltics the Black Sea there to really keep that discount. And that's what's going to make it attractive to find a home.

The gift will help fund digitizing the museum\u2019s collection \u2013 which includes tens of thousands of objections, oral testimonies, historic footage, archival documents and photographs \u2013 to make the material more accessible to scholars all over the world, the museum\u2019s director Sara Bloomfield told the Post, as well as help the museum boost its own research, educational programs and public exhibitions. Rubenstein\u2019s donation helped the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum reach its goal of raising $1 billion a year earlier than its target date of 2023, which will mark three decades since the museum opened. Rubenstein was persuaded to make the donation by several close associates who serve in the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council \u2013 the equivalent of the museum\u2019s board of trustees \u2013 including diplomat Stuart E. Eizenstat, whom Rubenstein worked for in the seventies, and Rubenstein\u2019s longtime business partner and Carlyle Group managing director Allan M. Holt, according to the Post. Rubenstein said he was happy to make the donation because it ties in with history and documentation, which he said is important to him, adding that he may have \u201cmade a mistake\u201d in not donating to the museum earlier.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the Holocaust and what happened, people say, \u2018Why didn\u2019t the U.S. do more? Why didn\u2019t we intervene?\u201d Rubenstein told the Post. \u201cWe are living in a similar moment \u2026 Antisemitism is on the rise in the world. People are saying, \u2018What can we do?' There are many things you can do, and reminding people of the Holocaust is one.\u201d\n\nReported antisemitic events in the U.S. jumped by about one-third last year, according to a report released the Anti-Defamation League last week. The ADL recorded 2,717 antisemitic incidents nationwide, which the group said was the highest number since the organization began tracking incidents in 1979.\n\nRubenstein is a cofounder of the Carlyle Group, which has $260 billion in assets under management, and Rubenstein is worth $3.8 billion alone, according to a Forbes estimate. He\u2019s known for making large philanthropic contributions, particularly in the arts. Last year, the 72-year-old donated $10 million to the Lincoln Center to help expand the number of free performances and continue coronavirus programming, like classes for U.S. citizenship and blood drives. Rubenstein also serves as the chairman of boards for the National Gallery of Art and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.

State gas giant Gazprom said neither country had agreed to President Vladimir Putin's demand that customers in \"unfriendly\" countries must open two accounts at Gazprombank \u2014 one in euros and the second in rubles, from which payments for the gas would be made.\n\nThe vast majority of Gazprom's contracts with its European customers stipulate payment in euros or dollars. The Kremlin's ultimatum regarding ruble payments is widely seen as a move to bolster its war chest and boost the Russian currency.\n\nGerman gas distributor Uniper said last week it would continue to pay for its Russian supplies in euros but added that it believed a \"payment conversion compliant with sanctions law\" was possible. It said it was examining the matter carefully in close coordination with the German government.\n\nLindner said he expected Germany's utilities to honor the terms of their contracts, which require payment in euros or dollars.\n\n\"Germany can't be blackmailed, we know there is a dependency on natural gas from Russia, it is a reality.

Each day was filled with a surprise for business leaders, revealing issues for first-mile delivery that had previously been taken for granted.\n\nSupply variability is the new normal. Variability is the highest in the history of supply chain management. In the last two years, traditional processes and technologies failed in the face of the challenge requiring greater dependency on ad-hoc manual processes. However, these two years are only a warm-up for what will come in the next thirty-sixty days.\n\nAcross the supply chain, dark clouds loom. China\u2019s zero-Covid policy, the fallout from the Russian/Ukraine conflict, heightened inflationary pressures, pending recession, migration and resettlement due to political unrest and food insecurity top the list. While the pressure on North American ports is currently abated and logistics constraints eases, this is the calm before the storm. The issue for global supply chains is that raw material supply\u2014either in warehouses or in transit within a country\u2014is usually forty-five days. We are nearing the breaking point on materials.\n\nChina accounts for 12% of global trade. Covid restrictions idled factories and warehouses, slowed truck deliveries, and created container logjams. In North America, warehouses are full, and containers sit outside distribution centers\u2014being used as outside storage\u2014while companies sort through mounds of the wrong inventories in the face of shifting demand. Expect fire sales across corporate America as Companies sort through inventory obsolescence.\n\nAs variability increases, long trade lanes are problematic. The transit of a container from China to Long Beach currently takes 111 days. (This is double the transit time of 2019). Current ship unloading at North American ports is for products manufactured before the lockdowns. Typically, a supply chain has 30-45 days of supply (raw materials in inventory and domestic transit).\n\nWill a potential slowdown due to a recession yield a reprieve? Sadly, the answer is no for the supply chain leader. The issue is the mix of inventory. While total volume may slow, recessionary shifts drive shifts in consumer preferences. While the press highlights China\u2019s efforts to continue manufacturing by quarantining the workers, this will not relieve the issue. The reason is the lack of supply for manufacturing to continue. China\u2019s shutdowns are a big knot that is becoming a noose in the supply chain. Looming potential shutdowns due to the no-COVID policy in other Chinese cities exacerbates the problem.\n\nToday, more than five hundred ships are waiting to unload at the port of Shanghai. Container wait time at the port to move inland in China is twelve days, up threefold from the prior month. Freight rates for Asia to the US West Coast are up 168% year-over-year, while rates from Asia to the US East Coast are 198%.\n\nWhen China recovers from Covid, expect prices to escalate just in time for a potential west coast port strike in the United States. Labor uncertainty looms with the contracts of 15,000 port workers expiring on July 1, 2022. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) represents twenty-nine West Coast Ports employees in Washington, Oregon, and California. The contract expires on July 1, 2022. If Shanghai factories restart in May (estimate by experts), the ocean containers will arrive during the labor negotiation. The last time an ILWU contract expired was in July 2014. Port operations slowed drastically as negotiations dragged into 2015, although no formal strike was declared. During the upcoming talks, the main sticking point is the badly needed port automation.\n\nUkrainians should be planning their fields. As a leading exporter of sunflower oil, wheat, and corn, today, the country\u2019s primary export is refugees. Europe faces energy instability. For manufacturers, it is about oil, gas, copper, helium, titanium, nickel, neon, and palladium from Russia and wheat, corn, sunflower oil, pig iron, and inert gases from Ukraine. The prolonged conflict between Russia and Ukraine negatively impacts Ukraine\u2019s long-term ability to supply the raw material gases neon, argon, krypton, and xenon needed for semiconductor production. (Ukraine currently provides nearly 70 percent of the world\u2019s neon gas capacity.) Food instability in Africa is projected because Russia and Ukraine supply 29% of worldwide wheat exports and 17% of corn, with significant exports to the middle east and Africa.\n\nWhile the press report first-order impacts, supply chain leaders need to plan for the second and third-order impacts. These are not always obvious. For example, catalytic converters use palladium. Russia produces 40% of the world\u2019s palladium. The rise in palladium prices will increase car theft of catalytic converters and drive a surge in demand in the market for guards to protect cars from theft. This is a third-order effect. Third-order effects will ripple uncontrollably through all supply chains.\n\nCurrent supply chain architectures assume that governments would be rational, variability would be low, and logistics would always be available. Quickly, you can assess that these three assumptions are no longer valid. However, this does not mean the end of the global supply chain.\n\nFor many companies, this is an opportunity to redesign their supply chain flows and take steps to drive digital innovation. Before the rise in variability, supply chains could be managed on enterprise data, and investments in transactional systems were sufficient. This is no longer the case. Instead, companies need to redesign supply chain processes to be outside-in and use market data and orchestrate signals market to market. Here are five steps to take:\n\u2022 Reduce Product Portfolios. In the face of increasing variability and shifting demand, the best step is to reduce the number of items in the product portfolio. The long tail of the supply chain\u2014things with low volume and high variability\u2014will be the most problematic to manage.\n\u2022 Use Digital Twin Technologies to Build Aggregate Buying Plans. With supply as a constraint, building long-range commodity buying strategies is critical. To accomplish this, consider using network design and digital twin technologies to understand the impact of variability, alternate supply, and potential shifts/capabilities in the bill of materials.\n\u2022 Look for Ways to Source Locally and Manufacture in the Market. While moving manufacturing and distribution sites is not easy, focus on simplifying platforms and finding sources of alternate supply in regions where products are sold.

A successful war of conquest would change power equations in Central Europe, embolden Putin even more, damage NATO, perhaps irrevocably, accelerate perceptions of U.S. decline, and perhaps set the stage for another war of conquest across the Taiwan Strait.\n\nGiven these stakes, Washington and its NATO partners stepped up to help Ukraine oppose the Russian invasion. In stage one of this war, they succeeded in foiling Putin\u2019s plans for a quick, decisive win. But this war isn\u2019t over, and Putin could still succeed in gaining additional territory in the east and creating a land bridge of Russian-held territory in the south.\n\nPutin could declare this a victory, despite the heavy military, economic and reputational costs to Russia from waging this war. Alternatively, Ukrainian troops, fortified by military equipment NATO was initially hesitant to provide, could extend Russian losses and reclaim territory in the second phase of this war.\n\nIt matters greatly how Ukraine, Russia, and NATO define winning and losing. Many armchair strategists in the United States who advocated ambitious wars in Afghanistan and Iraq now call for Putin to lose decisively. The U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin seemed to join them by stating, \u201cWe want to see Russia weakened to the degree it can\u2019t do the kinds of things it\u2019s done in Ukraine.\u201d The goal of decisive victory goes far beyond what U.S. and NATO leaders advocated at the onset of this war.\n\nMission creep happens. The initial purpose of the U.S. war in Afghanistan was to rout Al Qaeda. The initial purpose of the second U.S. war against Iraq was to topple Saddam Hussein. Both missions were accomplished early on. Then the George W. Bush administration changed the goal posts in both wars, in part because \u201cwinning\u201d could be short lived without systemic change. Both wars morphed into something more grandiose and utterly unachievable \u2014 the transformation of Afghanistan and Iraq into friendly, governable, democratic states.\n\nMission creep can also cause much sorrow in the war between Ukraine and Russia. Stopping Putin from succeeding in Ukraine is quite different from crippling his military\u2019s ability to wage aggressive war. There\u2019s no need for an ambitious war aim: Stopping Putin from succeeding in Ukraine is, by itself, the functional equivalent of preventing him from making the same mistake twice.\n\nIt\u2019s OK for Putin to claim a win in Ukraine that\u2019s an obvious loss. It\u2019s not OK for him to achieve important territorial gains in the east and in the south. What constitutes \u201cimportant\u201d territorial gains is for Ukraine\u2019s leadership to decide, just as it is Kiev\u2019s decision to assess the level of sacrifice required to deny and reverse Russian gains.\n\nOne reasonable definition of loss is that whatever Putin gains from waging aggressive war pales in comparison to Russian losses. These calculations include territory, but extend well beyond where the forward edge of battle congeals.\n\nThe pursuit of a decisive win by Ukraine and Putin\u2019s decisive loss would constitute another example of mission creep. Two of the likely consequences of mission creep would be great strains within NATO and greater desperation by Putin.\n\nIt\u2019s as essential to prevent the use of a nuclear weapon in this war as it is to deny Putin the functional equivalent of a victory. A mushroom cloud would have profoundly negative consequences for participants and onlookers in this war. Nuclear use would not only be a Hitlerian act; it would also seriously increase nuclear dangers on many fronts.\n\nThe odds against battlefield use remain high, but they are reduced the more government officials and armchair strategists advocate mission creep.\n\nIt\u2019s necessary for Putin to lose more than he gains in this war. It\u2019s also necessary to avoid mission creep.

In other words, if Kharkiv is the target, Saltivka is the bull\u2019s-eye.\n\nSaltivka sits on Kharkiv\u2019s northeast flank, the area closest to Russian troops deployed only a few miles away. Designed as a bedroom district, it housed anywhere from 500,000 to 800,000 people at its height, more than one-third of the city\u2019s population.\n\nFor those who remain, the constant back-and-forth between the Russian army and the Ukrainian artillery hidden among the brutalist Soviet-era high-rise towers has forced upon them a mostly subterranean existence, whose complications go well beyond bedding down in a shelter. Everyday life \u2014 tasks such as cooking, showering \u2014 now resembles a macabre, never-ending camping trip that an artillery round could end at any moment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to live here, but where would I go?\u201d said Natasha, a 62-year-old pensioner who only gave her first name for reasons of safety.\n\nShe stood in a recessed corner outside her apartment building, wearing a dark gray coat and a white woolen cap and preparing lunch \u2014 rich and chicken \u2014 al fresco. A saucepan with no handle sat on the skeletal remains of an oven. A burning pile of wood she had culled from splintered window frames and shutters served in lieu of a gas flame.\n\nFor weeks there has been no water or electricity. Volunteers risk the shelling to deliver water bottles, food and power-banks to charge up phones. Although she could sleep in the nearby subway station along with hundreds of others from the neighborhood, Natasha has preferred to stay at home.\n\n\u201cThe buildings here are the newest and strongest in the city,\u201d she said, pointing out the entrance to the basement.\n\nAfter another day of heavy shelling recently, however, she decided the time had come to pack up and go if possible.\n\nNot so for 29-year-old Gennady Krasavtsev, a builder with the red eyes and alcohol-infused breath of a heavy drinker, standing outside a nearby residential tower whose front was entirely scorched.\n\n\u201cThe roughly 300 people still here \u2014 they\u2019re going nowhere,\u201d he said as he sauntered back to a playground to watch a man silently stripping branches off a tree limb with a small ax.\n\nAs for why he won\u2019t move to a safer area just a mile away, he exhibits the fatalism common in Saltivka.\n\n\u201cEverywhere is dangerous. First they shoot here. Then they shoot the next square,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all the same.\u201d\n\nOthers had quit their homes but not the neighborhood. The last stop on Kharkiv\u2019s northeastern metro line, Heroiv Pratsi, now houses about 800 people on the edge of Saltivka. Within its bowels, day and night blend together. A few people venture up periodically for a smoke, or to feed chunks of stale bread to pigeons by the station entrance, but they rush back inside the moment shelling resumes.\n\nSleeping arrangements are improvisatory and cover every spare space near the turnstiles, stairs, platforms and subway carriages. Some try for a level of privacy and bring tents, or set up bunkbeds with covers draped over them, or fashion a cove in a subway carriage. There are fledgling attempts at creating a home: a few Lego and toys arrayed on a carriage window frame, a stuffed animal among flower-patterned pillows.\n\nThen there are cats, such as Simba and Marek, who prowled around Katya Talpa, a 35-year-old sales agent, occasionally scratching a piece of cardboard she had brought for that purpose.\n\nShe and her husband, Yura, 42, a builder, lived nearby, and their apartment \u2014 so far \u2014 was still in good condition. But the shelling was too intense, and they\u2019ve been sleeping in the subway since the invasion began.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be here so long. But we\u2019ll leave [eventually]. We believe in our victory,\u201d Talpa said.\n\nUp by the ticket concourse, 36-year-old Vladimir Kravitz gave a que-sera-sera smile when asked about his home.\n\n\u201cEight times the building was hit, but my apartment is fine,\u201d he said. So dangerous is his block that he doesn\u2019t try to visit it. Instead, he seemed fully at ease with life in the metro, sitting with a gaggle of friends and eating helpings of chicken, kasha, soup and pickled shredded carrot.\n\nThe people here are well-served, with volunteers delivering freshly cooked food three times a day from less-affected parts of Kharkiv, which have become staging grounds for a massive relief effort.\n\nAlongside a highway approaching Kharkiv, around a half-constructed compound, Pastor Ilya Gerasim of the Holy Trinity Church oversees an aid operation that on that day was feeding upwards of 2,000 people.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re afraid, depressed, desperate,\u201d Gerasim said. \u201cAnd we understand it\u2019s our duty to help them. And preach the Gospel.\u201d\n\nInside the compound, volunteers prepared bags of rice, kasha, fruit and cleaning products in an assembly line and handed them out to waiting recipients, some of whom began standing in line at 4 a.m.\n\nGerasim swung into action Feb. 24, amid the shock of a war he never expected would happen. He fielded calls from parishioners and fellow believers in Romania and elsewhere in the world seeking to help.\n\n\u201cWe prayed, and I could see those people who know and need to do the job. I had a good team, so we prepared units for medicine, packaging, food and delivery,\u201d Gerasim said.\n\nSoon they were feeding well over 2,000 people three times a week. Since the beginning of the war, they\u2019ve delivered tens of thousands of food packages, dispatched volunteers to cook meals in Saltivka (chefs wore flak jackets) and evacuated 11,000 people.\n\nAnother outfit is the World Central Kitchen, an aid group headed by Spanish celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s that works in 30 Ukrainian cities. In Kharkiv, its headquarters are a bar, where Roxana \u201cRoxy\u201d Pavlenko, 44, manages a constantly shifting menu of dishes along with a cadre of cooks. Earlier in April, a shell landed one afternoon near the bar, injuring four of the staff, according to World Central Kitchen CEO Nate Mook. Everyone still wanted to continue working there.\n\nAmong the volunteers bringing meals to war-blighted areas are Roman Knaziev, a 33-year-old physics doctoral graduate, and Anastasia Dolhoshapko, 28, who works as a travel agent; together they form a sort of Batman and Batgirl of meal-delivery assistance.\n\nOne relatively quiet afternoon \u2014 shelling had eased right after Easter \u2014 Knaziev and Dolhoshapko ferried food and medicine around the city center. Some districts here showed battle scars caused by cruise missiles, their explosive strength capable of shearing the facade off an entire building, exposing the rooms inside like a life-size dollhouse. But Knaziev proudly pointed out the area\u2019s relatively pristine condition under the circumstances, with municipal workers landscaping a public park, collecting detritus in a truck or fixing a light damaged in the blast.\n\n\u201cWe lost electricity here for one or two days, and that\u2019s because the city workers repair everything, even under fire,\u201d he said.\n\nSuch repairs wouldn\u2019t have been done so quickly before the war, Dolhoshapko said. But the crucible-like conditions had left in Kharkiv only those who wanted to do something, to help.\n\nBesides, she added, the shelling stopped registering for most people.\n\n\u201cThe other day a rocket struck our neighbor\u2019s garden and we had no idea until he told us,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have noticed even if it hit our garden. We\u2019re too busy.\u201d\n\nMany people in Kharkiv have become unwilling experts on ordnance, like Lena Asachya, 59, and her husband, Oleh, 58, who live in Piatykhatky, a northern neighborhood also near the front line.\n\n\u201cI can tell the difference between tanks, artillery, Grad [rocket launchers]. We\u2019re all experts here,\u201d Asachya said, as Knaziev and Dolhoshapko lugged boxes of supplies to her building\u2019s backyard, where her husband was boiling water.\n\nAsachya has become the caretaker for the abandoned pets on the block, feeding an assortment of cats, dogs and other animals that congregated in front of her when she fished out pet food from one of the boxes. A loud boom interrupted the conversation. Nobody flinched, not even the animals.\n\n\u201cWe know from the sound where it\u2019s going. That\u2019s not close,\u201d she said.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just the animals that make her and Oleh stay. A few dozen other people continue to live on their block, and they all support each other. Oleh, who worked as a chef, is in charge of fashioning a proper meal from the donated goods. Despite the danger, Lena and Oleg rarely sleep in the basement.\n\n\u201cWe have kind of a community here,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried, of course. But it\u2019s my home.\u201d", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-02-26/ukrainian-forces-hold-kyiv-russia-invasion", "https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-04-20/ukraine-war-refugees-top-5-million", "https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-04-08/bombs-ukraine-maternity-ward-newborns-moms", "https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-03-25/punishing-russian-bombardment-ravages-ukraines-second-city", "https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-03-29/a-ukraine-soldiers-story-in-the-face-of-russian-bombs-its-my-country-its-my-city", "https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-04-28/biden-asking-congress-for-more-ukraine-aid-power-to-seize-russian-oligarchs-assets", "https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2022-01-03/jose-andres-bazaar-meat-los-angeles-restaurant-opening", "https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-02-24/why-is-russia-invading-ukraine", "https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-03-04/explainer-weapons-used-russia-ukraine-invasion", "https://www.latimes.com/world-nation", "https://www.latimes.com/projects/ukraine-civilians-refugees-russian-invasion/", "https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-05-01/ukraine-garrison-church"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": "c0aa1da868764eb081205783065925ed", "name": "Nabih Bulos"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "people", "weight": 0.059456673}, {"name": "most people", "weight": 0.05858247}, {"name": "Many people", "weight": 0.058074195}, {"name": "home", "weight": 0.04537325}, {"name": "subway carriages", "weight": 0.04507768}, {"name": "cities", "weight": 0.044939462}, {"name": "day", "weight": 0.04486728}, {"name": "pet food", "weight": 0.044535965}, {"name": "other animals", "weight": 0.04371119}, {"name": "food packages", "weight": 0.04229468}], "topics": [{"name": "Ukraine"}, {"name": "Russia-Ukraine War"}], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "Russian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Ukrainian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Spanish", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ukraine", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Kharkiv", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 10}, {"data": "Saltivka", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "Romania", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Piatykhatky", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the United Nations", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Holy Trinity Church", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the World Central Kitchen", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Europe", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "World War II", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "any moment", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "night", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "4 a.m.", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "one afternoon", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Natasha", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Gennady Krasavtsev", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Katya Talpa", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Yura", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Vladimir Kravitz", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ilya Gerasim", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Roxana \u201cRoxy\u201d Pavlenko", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Nate Mook", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Roman Knaziev", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Anastasia Dolhoshapko", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Batman", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Batgirl", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Lena Asachya", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Oleh", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Oleg", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Heroiv Pratsi", "type": "FAC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Grad", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.023457343, "negative": 0.59282124, "neutral": 0.38372138}, "summary": "\n\nBut those terrible zoomed-out figures obscure a surprising close-up reality: namely, that the violence in this northeastern city is mostly localized, with some of the heaviest bombardments in Europe since World War II hitting one part of Kharkiv, a district called Saltivka, while just a few miles up the road people are out walking their dogs, lounging in the park or shopping.\n\nAs long as you\u2019re not in that district, you stand a reasonably good chance of having a relatively normal day.

The government admitted on Thursday it was aware of the problem after MPs from the across the Commons raised concerns about families waiting up to five weeks for news of their application.\n\nAccording to the latest government figures, 59,000 people have had visas approved but have not yet arrived in the UK. Only 15% of the 74,700 Ukrainians who applied under the sponsorship route have made it to Britain.\n\nA large number of those who have not yet arrived will be people waiting for other family members to receive their visas before travelling; children\u2019s applications usually take longer because the UK requires them to undergo security scans if they do not have their own international passport.\n\nHowever, a significant proportion of the 59,000 Ukrainians will be people who have had visas approved but have not been informed of the approval.\n\nAmanda Jones, an immigration and public law barrister, has been instructed to launch legal proceedings on behalf of \u201cmany hundreds\u201d of Ukrainians, in litigation organised by members of the groups Vigil for Visas and Taking Action Over the Homes for Ukraine Visa Delays. This could include mounting a judicial review case against the Home Office.\n\nLegal action is also being prepared on behalf of lone children who have been unable to access foster placements set up for them in the UK due to the visa delays.\n\nAna\u00efs Crane, a case worker at Wilsons Solicitors who is working with Here For Good Ukraine Project and representing several unaccompanied Ukrainian children, said they had been waiting longer than a month for a decision and were starting to give up hope. \u201cMany of them are now considering returning to Ukraine due to their precarious situations in Europe,\u201d she said.\n\nYvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, described the delay between visas being approved and sent out as \u201cinexplicable and disgraceful\u201d and urged the Home Office to disclose how many people had been affected and what steps it was taking to address the problem.\n\nShe added: \u201cFor families who have already fled war zones to then be stuck in limbo even longer because the Home Office can\u2019t even get its act together to notify people when the visas have been granted is appalling. Long delays are making families more vulnerable to exploitation.\u201d\n\nKirsty McNeill, an executive director at Save the Children and a former Downing Street adviser, said the red tape was increasing the danger for some of the 1.5 million children who had fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion on 24 February.\n\nShe said: \u201cPart of [the government\u2019s] argument for the bureaucracy and the slowness is that it is keeping people safe. But actually it\u2019s a lack of pace that is endangering children more than anything.\u201d\n\nThe chief executive of the Refugee Council, Enver Solomon, said stories of women and children being stuck in dangerous situation were the \u201cdreadful but inevitable consequence\u201d of an approach that was \u201cflawed from the start\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cResponding to what is clearly a serious humanitarian crisis with two visa routes \u2026 was always going to result in paper and bureaucracy being put before people and their needs. Tragically, we are now witnessing the fallout of that approach.\u201d\n\nThe International Rescue Committee said the UK was \u201can outlier\u201d in Europe for requiring those fleeing war to apply for visas before they arrive. Ireland, which does not require visas for arrivals, has taken in roughly the same number of Ukrainians as the UK despite its population being a thirteenth of the size of Britain\u2019s.\n\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cIn response to Putin\u2019s barbaric invasion we launched one of the fastest and biggest visa schemes in UK history.

She filed the paperwork on 24 March and flew to Poland the following week to collect her young relative.\n\nThey have been waiting there ever since. Diana\u2019s application is among tens of thousands stuck in a byzantine system that charities say is worsening the trauma of those fleeing war.\n\nPevny, 58, said she faced the prospect of having to send Diana back to Ukraine as she could no longer afford to stay in Poland.\n\n\u201cIt cannot be right for a 12-year-old girl to leave a war zone and then, because the UK has a glitch in their visa scheme, have to go back to a war zone where Russians are committing war crimes against children and mothers,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re reading about all these mothers and children, who are Diana\u2019s age, who are being raped around Kyiv. Can I actually as a human being return this child to Ukraine?\u201d\n\nPevny was told twice by the Home Office to apply to host Diana under the Homes for Ukraine scheme because, as a distant relative, she would not qualify as a close family member, although they are incredibly close as families and celebrate all their holidays together.\n\nBut weeks after submitting an application under Homes for Ukraine, she found out that the rules had changed so that unaccompanied under-18s could not be brought to Britain.\n\nThe safeguarding reasons behind this may be sound, but the change was not publicised or communicated to Pevny, who only found out when her MP, Daniel Zeichner, looked into her case. She now faces another long wait as her application is rerouted to the family scheme, with no prospect of success.\n\nPevny said Diana was \u201ctraumatised\u201d by the process: \u201cShe thinks that the UK does not want her. She thinks that I will leave her in Poland or send her back to the war zone.

They are scattered across Europe as they approach their sixth week of waiting for the green light to travel to the UK.\n\nRichards, 35, discovered on 4 April that more than half of his 22 applicants had been approved for visas but had not received them. He learned this only because Home Office officials visited a Ukrainian cultural centre near his home in Reading, so he asked them to check the status of their applications.\n\nThey had been approved, some weeks ago, but never sent. He was astonished; the Home Office officials looked concerned. They came back four days later after looking into the issue. \u201cThey recognised it was a problem,\u201d Richards said.\n\nThe government only officially acknowledged the problem on Thursday, the day parliament was prorogued. Potentially thousands of people could have arrived in the UK weeks ago if their visas had been dispatched as soon as they had been approved.\n\nThree of Richards\u2019 cases received visas 16 days after they were authorised. But that family are still in limbo halfway across Europe because three of their group are still waiting for their paperwork.\n\nRichards said the UK had \u201cfundamentally let down a group of people we should have been there for as a country\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cWhen you see that tens of thousands of people have supposedly been granted visas but haven\u2019t got here yet, it\u2019s impossible not to think the problem could be that widespread.\u201d\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think they realise what we have been through\u2019\n\nAlexandra, a Ukrainian refugee, said she was at a loss to understand why she has had to wait six weeks for a straightforward visa application to be processed. She fled Kherson and her visa application was lodged on the day the scheme opened, 18 March.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s a joke and a game from government for us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes me so mad, the suspense and zero information. I don\u2019t think they realise what we have been through.\u201d\n\nSince fleeing Kherson with only her passport and a few items of clothing, Alexandra has been on a dangerous journey passing through Russia, Turkey and Bulgaria to get to Romania, where she is waiting for her visa to come through.\n\nA home is waiting for her in Warwickshire, where she has been sponsored by Daniel Edwards. But still the wait goes on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve exhausted so many different options trying to get in touch with MPs, the Home Office helpline, the visa office but there are still no results and no hope,\u201d said Edwards.\n\n\u201cThe woman I\u2019m sponsoring has been on such a dangerous journey from border to border. The visa should have arrived at least four weeks ago.

The U.N. office noted the true civilian death toll is likely \u201cconsiderably higher\u201d due to the difficulty in confirming reports from heavily besieged regions, and Ukrainian authorities have estimated thousands of more civilians have died as a result of the war.

One Russian Bullet Ended It All.\n\nIryna Abramova at the grave of her husband, Oleh Abramov, who was killed by Russian forces outside their home in Bucha, Ukraine.\n\nOver nearly two decades, Iryna Abramova and her husband, Oleh, built a life of love and happiness. Now, she says, she wishes the Russian soldiers had shot her, too. BUCHA, Ukraine \u2014 She called him Sunshine. He called her Kitty. They met nearly 20 years ago when she was working at a hospital and he sauntered through the door, young, muscular and beautiful, to fix the roof. Iryna Abramova said she made the first move and followed him to where he smoked cigarettes behind a wall. They started talking and fell in love, she said, \u201cword by word.\u201d But a few weeks ago, the special connection she had with Oleh, the love of her life, and everything they built together ended in a single cruel gunshot. What follows is difficult for Iryna to describe, she said, because it feels so raw and real but, at the same time, it\u2019s still almost impossible to believe. On the morning of March 5, Iryna said, Russian soldiers attacked her house. They threw a grenade through the window, which started an enormous fire, and marched her and Oleh outside at gunpoint.\n\nA Russian commander leveled his gun at her chest not once, not twice but three times. To this day she regrets he didn\u2019t pull the trigger. \u201cMaybe my destiny is to die tomorrow,\u201d Iryna said, admitting that she had thought of suicide. But she added, \u201cIt\u2019s a big thing to take your own life and then I won\u2019t be able to meet my husband in heaven.\u201d Iryna Abramova\u2019s story is Bucha\u2019s story. It is about heartbreak, bloodshed and, most of all, loss. This Ukrainian town, not far from the capital, Kyiv, is where the war\u2019s worst atrocities have been discovered, and as the days pass the full scope of the terror and butchery only grows. The Russians slaughtered at least 400 civilians here in March, officials have said. Weeks later, mutilated bodies are still being found.\n\nAt 40, he was eight years younger than Iryna, and she allows herself a faint smile about that. \u201cI stole him,\u201d she said. A few months after they met, he moved in. They got married, and unusually, he took her last name, becoming Oleh Oleksandrovych Abramov. He encouraged her to quit her job as a hospital clerk, saying he would support them. They never had children, but Iryna said they had the perfect family: the two of them. During the week, he worked hard as a welder and often returned late, when she was already in bed watching TV. On weekends, they\u2019d grill in their back yard and occasionally catch a movie at the nearby Giraffe Mall in Irpin. A few weeks ago, the mall was shelled to smithereens. \u2018Oleh Will Not Be Coming\u2019 Russian troops rolled into Bucha soon after the war started. But they got stalled by fierce Ukrainian resistance. On Feb. 27, Ukrainian forces ambushed a long column of Russian armor parked along Iryna\u2019s street, leaving at least 20 destroyed vehicles and an unknown number of Russian soldiers dead. May 2, 2022, 10:28 a.m. ET\n\u2022 Escaping Mariupol, one resident said that those left behind were gripped with \u2018hopelessness.\u2019 Oleh became especially nervous after that, Iryna said. He could sense the Russians would be out for revenge. He insisted that he and Iryna stay indoors and they spent many hours in the kitchen, on the floor. As they lay side by side, fingers touching, she could feel him shaking. \u201cI asked him: Are you afraid of death? He said, \u2018No, I am afraid for you.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Russians were sitting on the curb, drinking water from plastic bottles, just watching me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t say anything, they didn\u2019t show any emotion. They were like an audience at the theater.\u201d That\u2019s when she let out a \u201cwild cry, like something I have never heard,\u201d her father said. \u201cShoot me!\u201d she screamed. \u201cShoot me and the cat!\u201d Mariupol evacuation. Ukrainian officials vowed to continue a large-scale evacuation from the ruined city despite renewed Russian shelling that has threatened to derail the effort to rescue hundreds of civilians sheltering under a steel plant. On the ground. Russian forces pummeled targets in eastern and southern Ukraine, continuing an offensive that has struggled to claim much new ground even as they suffer heavy casualties. A British intelligence agency said that the Russian losses in the war have been staggering, Pelosi\u2019s visit. In a sign of the United States\u2019 deepening commitment to Ukraine, Speaker Nancy Pelosi became the most senior American official to visit Kyiv, meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky and vowing to back Ukraine \u201cuntil victory is won.\u201d She was looking at the soldiers, staring at their boots, but the commander eventually lowered his gun and said, \u201cI do not kill women.\u201d He gave Iryna and her father three minutes to leave. Bucha\u2019s population is around 40,000, but all but 3,000 to 4,000 residents had fled before the Russian occupation, city officials said. Around 400 civilians are thought to have been killed, meaning about one of 10 people who were here. Some were shot execution style with hands tied behind their backs. Others were horribly beaten. Many were like Oleh: no military experience, unarmed and posing no obvious threat. So many bodies were left on Bucha\u2019s streets that city officials worried about a plague. But they didn\u2019t have enough workers to collect the bodies. So they drafted volunteers. One of them was Vladyslav Minchenko, a tattoo artist. \u201cThe most blood I had ever seen was in a piercing,\u201d he said wryly. But soon he was picking up dead people and body parts, zipping them into black bags and taking them to a communal grave outside Bucha\u2019s main church. He retrieved Oleh\u2019s body, with its shattered head, he said, which was verified by video evidence.\n\nNowhere to Go Iryna doesn\u2019t have the option to leave, even if she wanted it. Without a passport or identity papers \u2014 it was all burned in the fire \u2014 she is not allowed through any of the military checkpoints in the area. Bucha officials said that they could not help her at the moment because their computer systems were still down and that the only way for her to get new documents was to go to Kyiv or another city, Boyarka. It\u2019s a Catch-22 since she needs the papers to travel. So she doesn\u2019t go far. She has almost no money and even if she were able to buy things like food, the main supermarkets in Bucha were blown up. That has left many residents like her trudging through the drizzly streets wrapped in dark jackets, searching for humanitarian relief centers where they can get a loaf of bread, a jar of pickles, anything.\n\n\u201cI used to say that I had the best family in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cOne husband. Three cats. And one dog. Standing in her yard, surrounded by burned beams, burned pots, her whole life basically burned \u2014 the bodies of her dog and two cats somewhere in that same ash \u2014 she said, \u201cIt\u2019s like I look at this but I keep seeing my old house.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019ve made a wrong turn into a parallel reality and there is another reality where my house and my husband still exist. And here in this reality I am alone.\u201d She allows herself to dream. There\u2019s one scene she can\u2019t get out of her head, a good scene that she keeps replaying.

report.\n\nPutin will transfer control of Russia\u2019s government to Nikolai Patrushev, head of the Russian federal police\u2019s Security Council, while he is incapacitated during and after the procedure, according to a video from the mysterious Telegram channel \u201cGeneral SVR\u201d on Saturday.\n\nThe channel \u2014 which is purportedly run by a former Russian Foreign Intelligence Service lieutenant general known pseudonym \u201cViktor Mikhailovich\u201d \u2014 reported that Putin has been told by doctors that he must undergo an operation.\n\nThe anticipated surgery and recovery are expected to incapacitate Putin for \u201ca short time,\u201d according to the unconfirmed report.\n\n\u201cPutin is unlikely to agree to hand over power for a longer period of time,\u201d

the narrator adds. \u201cPatrushev is an outright villain. He is no better than Vladimir Putin. Moreover, he is a more cunning, and I would say, more insidious person than Vladimir Putin. If he comes to power, Russians\u2019 problems will only multiply.\u201d\n\n\u201cViktor Mikhailovich\u201d ominously hinted that he and his allies \u201cwill make certain efforts so this does not happen, and I hope we will succeed.\u201d\n\nThe insider claimed that Putin\u2019s cancer is progressing, but darkly quipped that he doesn\u2019t want to give viewers \u201cfalse hope.\u201d\n\nPutin, 70, whose sickly appearance and uncharacteristically fidgety behavior in public have recently raised questions about his health, has been rumored to suffer from cancer and a host of other serious maladies, including Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nPutin\u2019s suspected health problems come at a particularly inopportune moment, with the war in Ukraine now in its third month and Russia suffering heavy losses on the battlefield.\n\nIn a Telegram post that appeared Thursday, it was alleged that Patrushev had had a two-hour \u201cheart-to-heart\u201d conversation with Putin.\n\n\u201cWe know that Putin signaled to Patrushev that he considers him to be practically his only trusted ally and friend in the government,\u201d the post claimed. \u201cAdditionally, the president promised that if his health takes a turn for the worse, actual control of the country will temporarily pass into Patrushev\u2019s hands.\u201d\n\nIn early April, the authors behind the Telegram channel claimed that Putin\u2019s doctors had recommended surgery for later that month, but that did not happen.\n\n\u201cGeneral SVR\u201d has been reporting on Putin\u2019s supposed oncology diagnosis since at least November 2020, claiming that the Russian dictator suffers from bowel cancer.\n\nAnother Russian investigative news outlet, Proekt, claimed last month that Putin had been visited dozens of times by a top thyroid cancer surgeon at his Black Sea residence.\n\nNew questions were raised about Putin\u2019s physical state last month when he was seen tightly gripping a desk during his meeting with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu.\n\nKremlin has consistently denied that Putin suffers from any medical problems.", "medium": "Article", "links":

of the United Nations World Food Programme in Germany has warned that millions of tonnes of grain is stuck in Ukraine due to sea ports being blocked by Russian military action.\n\nMartin Frick said about 4.5 million tonnes of grain in containers at Ukrainian ports could not be shifted due to unsafe or occupied sea routes, some of which had been mined, as well as inaccessible ports.\n\n\u201cNone of the grain can be used right now. It is just sitting there,\u201d Frick told the German news agency DPA.\n\nUkraine is one of the world\u2019s leading producers of wheat as well as being a major corn producer. About 30m tonnes of corn and about 25m tonnes of wheat were harvested in the country in 2020, according to the UN. Many countries in north Africa in particular are dependent for their basic food provision on low-cost wheat from Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe world urgently needs these items of food from Ukraine,\u201d Frick said.\n\nDespite the abundance of crops still available in Ukraine, the World Food Programme (WFP) said that since the start of the invasion on 24 February, it had had to provide 2.5 million Ukrainians with food support \u2013 the majority of them in Ukraine, as well as several hundred thousand in neighbouring Moldova.\n\n\u201cFoodstuffs have to reach those in Ukraine who are trapped and in need. But at the same time there is the need to provide other parts of the world with foodstuffs they are expecting from Ukraine, in order to alleviate a global food crisis,\u201d Frick said.\n\nAccess to the ports for both incoming and outgoing goods was blocked, he said. He added that he feared food supplies were being used as a weapon in the conflict. \u201cHunger must not be used as a weapon, neither from a military, nor from an economic standpoint,\u201d he said.\n\nThe German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has responded to the food crisis by pledging Germany would step in and help where there are food shortages as a result of the war, warning of the strong possibility of a global food crisis.\n\n\u201cThis war will have consequences, consequences across the world,\u201d he said on Sunday, addressing protesters who accused him of prolonging the war by sending weaponry into the country. \u201cRight now we must concern ourselves with the fact that there are some people who will starve, that there are countries which will be unable to afford grain for their people and that this whole war situation could lead to a global hunger crisis.\u201d\n\nIt was last week confirmed by the German government and DB Cargo, the logistics arm of the national rail operator, that plans to enable blocked supplies of grain as well as supplies elsewhere in the country, amounting to around 20m tonnes, to leave the country via rail were being worked on.\n\nThe plan, being called a \u201cGetreidbr\u00fccke\u201d or \u201cgrain bridge\u201d, involves cooperation between Ukrainian Railways and the national rail operators of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania to ensure a network of interconnected routes across Europe.\n\n\u201cWe are currently working on concrete details as to precisely how the grain bridge could be realised,\u201d Michael Theurer, a parliamentary state secretary in the transport ministry, told the financial daily Handelsblatt. Theurer said leaving aside the logistical challenges, among the sticking points of the plan that were being hammered out by the finance, agriculture, economics and development ministry were how to finance the measures and legal questions over competition neutrality.\n\nThe trains that would be sent into Ukraine would be also bringing much needed agricultural machinery, including tractors and replacement parts, to support farmers who are sowing seeds for summer crops.\n\nThe operation is an extension of DB Cargo\u2019s campaign \u201crailbridge for relief aid\u201d campaign, which began in March. Each train can transport 52 containers, amounting to several thousand tonnes of aid.", "medium": "Article", "links":

along with smaller rises in hospitalizations.", "content": "Hello, it\u2019s Monday, May 2, and here are the stories you shouldn\u2019t miss today:\n\nAfter months of declining numbers, California has recorded a nearly 30% increase in coronavirus cases over the past week along with smaller rises in hospitalizations, causing some health officials to suspect that the state is headed into a new pandemic wave.\n\nThe increase coincides with a loosening of COVID-19 restrictions such as mask mandates and vaccine verification rules, as well as the rise of new subvariants of the highly transmissible Omicron strain. The question now is how much higher cases will go and whether new government intervention will be needed.\n\u2022 Black and Latino Americans remain far more cautious in their approach to the COVID-19 pandemic than white Americans.\n\u2022 The Food and Drug Administration has set tentative dates in June to publicly review COVID-19 vaccines for the youngest American children.\n\u2022 Beijing is starting to resemble other Chinese cities grappling with the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus.\n\nStay up to date on variant developments, case counts and vaccine news with Coronavirus Today.\n\nNine months after the Los Angeles City Council adopted a new law allowing council members to designate areas as off-limits to homeless camps, permanent metal signs setting deadlines for all homeless people to leave have been posted at more than 100 locations.\n\nBut tents and makeshift shelters remain at many of the sites even weeks or months past the deadlines, as outreach workers struggle to persuade people to move voluntarily and the Los Angeles Police Department has issued tickets sparingly.\n\nAn insufficient number of outreach workers and a lack of interim housing options have hindered the implementation of the law, according to homeless services providers, and city and county officials.\n\u2022 Black Lives Matter-L.A. leader Melina Abdullah, a professor at Cal State Los Angeles, said she was forcibly removed by police officers from the mayoral debate on the campus.

Currently, the average potable water use across the MWD\u2019s service area amounts to 125 gallons per person per day.\n\nThe number is not arbitrary: Southern California communities that are dependent on water delivered from Northern California by the State Water Project normally demand about 380,000 acre-feet of water between June and December. But the projected supply during the second half of this year is far less \u2014 only 250,000 acre-feet.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi reaffirmed U.S. military, economic and humanitarian support for Ukraine, a day after she and a delegation of Democratic lawmakers met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the capital as intense fighting raged in the country\u2019s eastern region.\n\nSpeaking from neighboring Poland, Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said Ukraine needed the West\u2019s assistance to deal with the \u201cdevastating human toll taken on the Ukrainian people by [President Vladimir] Putin\u2019s diabolic invasion.\u201d\n\nIn the port city of Mariupol, about 100 civilians were evacuated from a sprawling steelworks plant that is a final redoubt of Ukrainian defenders and hundreds of noncombatants.

Ukraine says Moscow is trying to render its eastern heartland uninhabitable.\n\nYou got into your dream school, but it\u2019s pricey. Can California help pay for it?\n\nAmid rising college costs and economic uncertainty, students are more dependent than ever on financial aid. More than 70% of 76,000 California students surveyed in 2020 by the California Student Aid Commission said their families had lost part or all of their incomes during the COVID-19 pandemic and nearly two-thirds said they worried \u201ca lot\u201d about paying for tuition and fees.\n\nCalifornia is mounting one of its largest-ever efforts to make college affordable \u2014 providing more than $1 billion in additional funding for expanded financial aid, affordable student housing and cheaper textbook costs.

Construction on the bridge had started in January 1933 \u2014 mid-Depression, when men were desperate for work \u2014 and builders faced a number of challenges, including storms, tides and Bay Area fog.

(Maxar Technologies/Reuters) A Ukrainian commander inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol said his men experienced a turbulent night after the first batch of evacuees were able to leave the plant on Sunday. \"As soon as the evacuation of civilians was completed yesterday, the enemy began using all kinds of weapons. The night was restless,\" said Denys Shleha, commander of the 12th Operational Brigade of the National Guard. \n\n\"The [Russian] naval artillery worked on Azovstal from 2 a.m. to 3 a.m.. In the morning it became quieter.\" It is unclear whether another batch of civilians trapped inside the complex will be able to leave on Monday. \"I will not say anything about the evacuation from Azovstal. We are trying our best to do it, we are begging for it,\" Shleha said. He said there are about 200 people, including 20 children, left on the premises. We beg that people should be removed from Azovstal. The enemy strikes with all kinds of weapons. Everything is very bad,\" he said. \"The biggest problem is wounded servicemen. Our field hospital was bombed a few days ago. Medical care is provided to the military in extremely difficult conditions. There are currently about 500 of them at Azovstal. Their injuries are of varying severity. This is the biggest problem that needs to be resolved,\" Shleha said. Shleha also spoke of the need to get the remaining fighters out of the plant. \"After the evacuation of civilians and the wounded, it is necessary to resolve issues with the garrison. Our men did everything possible and impossible for the state of the world during these 68 days,\" he said.\n\nUkrainian Army medical units unload a shell-shocked and concussed soldier at a medical facility in Kramatorsk, Ukraine, on April 29. (Scott Peterson/Getty Images) Russian forces are pressing an offensive in the direction of Sloviansk, an important town in the Donetsk region, according to the Ukrainian military. The offensive involves heavy shelling of Ukrainian defenses, the General Staff said in its daily update. The enemy fired on the units of our troops on the Lyman-Siversk border in order to oust them from their positions and create conditions for the attack on Sloviansk,\" it said. Some analysts say Russian forces have made modest territorial gains in this region over the past week, but Lyman remains in Ukrainian hands. The General Staff said Russian forces were attacking a large number of towns in the Luhansk region, and had tried to improve their positions around the town of Popasna by moving one battalion tactical group from Mariupol. Altogether 10 attacks in Donetsk and Luhansk had been repulsed and Ukrainian forces had destroyed a wide variety of Russian hardware, it claimed. \"The enemy deployed additional surface-to-air missile systems in the temporarily occupied territories of the Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions,\" it said. Three people in Luhansk were killed as heavy shelling persisted in Lysychansk, Zolote and Popasna, according to Serhiy Hayday, head of Luhansk's military administration. In areas of southern Ukraine where fighting continues, Russian forces were looking for weaknesses in Ukrainian defenses to the south of Mykolaiv as they try to extend their control to the whole of the Kherson region, which borders Crimea, the General Staff said. Parts of southern Zaporizhzhia have also seen heavy fighting. The regional command said Monday that \"the enemy tried to break through in small groups with the support of armored vehicles, tanks and artillery, but failed.\" The towns of Polohy and Orikhiv were among those targeted with shelling, it said. It also claimed that Russian forces were forcing farmers \"under the barrels of machine guns\" to sell grain at a steep discount. There has also been an uptick in attacks on grain stores and elevators. Valentyn Reznichenko, head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional state administration, said Monday that a grain warehouse had been destroyed in the Synelnykove district.\n\nUN-supported convoy will try to leave Mariupol on Monday, city council says In this image provided by the International Committee of the Red Cross, a Red Cross official waves a white flag while approaching the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, Sunday. (International Committee of the Red Cross/AP) A convoy supported by the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross will attempt to leave Mariupol on Monday, the city council said in a Telegram post. \u201cThere is good news. With the support of the UN and Red Cross, today two additional locations have been agreed upon for placing people in the evacuation convoy that will leave Mariupol,\u201d the post read. The convoy will collect civilians at several pickup points around Mariupol before taking them to two villages near the southern Ukrainian city of Berdiansk, according to the city council. Civilian evacuations from Mariupol -- which has endured weeks of Russian shelling and airstrikes -- were paused by local authorities on Sunday for \u201csecurity reasons.\u201d Before the pause, some 100 people were successfully evacuated from the besieged Azovstal steelworks. According to recent estimates, roughly 100,000 civilians still remain in the city. Last week during a one-on-one meeting with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres in Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed in principle to allow the UN and Red Cross to assist in civilian evacuations from Mariupol.\n\nSome South Korean embassy staff return to Kyiv, Foreign Ministry says The South Korean ambassador to Ukraine, alongside some members of staff from the embassy in Kyiv, returned to the city on Saturday and will restart operations on Monday, South Korea\u2019s foreign ministry said. Ambassador Kim Hyung-tae and the staff members returned to the capital from Chernivtsi, in western Ukraine. The city was one of the two locations where the embassy has been operating temporary offices. The embassy will carry out diplomatic work and protect South Korean citizens by closely cooperating with the Ukrainian government from Kyiv,\u201d the ministry said. The remaining embassy workers in Chernivtsi and Romania may gradually return to Kyiv, depending on the local situation, the ministry added. South Korea\u2019s embassy moved out of Kyiv on March 2 because of escalating violence around the capital region and began working from temporary offices in the Ukrainian cities of Lviv and Chernivtsi. The offices in Lviv closed on March 18. The foreign ministry said there are also temporary offices in Romania.\n\nJill Biden to travel to Romania and Slovakia on mission to support Ukrainian refugees First Lady Jill Biden delivers remarks during the Council of Chief State School Officers' 2022 National and State Teachers of the Year event, in the White House, on Apr. 27 (Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters) First lady Jill Biden will travel to Romania and Slovakia this week in a show of support for displaced Ukrainian families forced to flee bloodshed and violence in their home country in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion.

Wrapping up: On Monday, May 9, Biden will wrap up her trip by meeting members of the Slovakian government before leaving for the US. The trip will be the First Lady\u2019s second solo foreign trip; in July she went to Japan to attend the opening ceremony of the Olympics.\n\nIt's 7 a.m. in Kyiv. Here's what you need to know The Azovstal steel plant in the besieged city of Mariupol came under fire after about 100 civilians were evacuated on Sunday, according to a Ukrainian soldier.

The world body is also assisting Monday with a second day of evacuations from the southern city of Mariupol, where at least hundreds of people have been surrounded by Russian troops in a sprawling steel plant that has become the last redoubt of Ukrainian forces and some civilians.\n\nPelosi (D-San Francisco), who was joined by several high-ranking congressional Democrats, said in a statement from Warsaw that they \u201cexpressed America\u2019s deep gratitude to the Polish government and Polish people\u201d for taking in refugees and aiding Ukrainian fighters. Polish President Andrzej Duda, in brief public remarks, called the war a \u201ccrucial\u201d time for his country.\n\nPelosi, the highest-level U.S. official to visit Ukraine since Russia invaded Feb. 24, was scheduled to depart the region later Monday. Her swing through Ukraine and Poland followed a similar tour last week by the U.S. secretaries of State and Defense.\n\nIn Ukraine, Russian forces have largely taken over Mariupol, a strategic port on the Sea of Azov. President Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking in his nightly video address, said he expected around 100 Mariupol civilians who were evacuated Sunday to arrive Monday in the inland city of Zaporizhzhia.\n\nZelensky described evacuation corridors as one of the few subjects to see progress from off-and-on talks between Russia and Ukraine. He said about 350,000 people had been given safe passageway from battle zones over the last months.\n\nAt the same time, there was a report of new attacks on Mariupol, a once-thriving cosmopolitan city where reported mass graves and dwindling food supplies have turned it into a symbol of the war\u2019s brutality.\n\nA mayoral aid, Petro Andryushchenko, said Monday that Mariupol\u2019s Azovstal steel plant was hit with shelling Sunday even as evacuations overseen by the U.N. and the International Red Cross were taking place.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the buses left Azovstal with the evacuees, new shelling began immediately,\u201d Andryushchenko said in a Ukrainian TV interview.\n\nInformation on the the situation at the steelworks has been difficult to obtain and ascertain even for local officials. Some estimates have put the number of those surrounded by Russian troops at 600. Others have said there are at least 2,000 people taking shelter in the complex.\n\nA commander in Ukraine\u2019s national guard, Denys Shlega, said Sunday in a televised interview that there were \u201cseveral dozen small children\u201d there as well as 500 injured soldiers and \u201cnumerous\u201d bodies of the dead.\n\nThe worst fighting continued overnight in eastern Ukraine, where a 300-mile battlefront has become a center of Russia\u2019s attempt to capture the industrial Donbas region.\n\nIn its morning operational update, the Ukrainian military said that Russia had deployed more anti-aircraft missile systems in occupied areas of Luhansk, one of the two provinces that make up the Donbas, and that there was a continuing threat of missile strikes in the battle zone from Belarus, Ukraine\u2019s northern neighbor and an ally of Russia.\n\nIn his video address, Zelensky said Moscow had also hit residential neighborhoods along with food warehouses in other areas of Donbas as well as in Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-biggest city. Zelensky said Russian President Vladimir Putin was conducting a \u201ca war of extermination.\u201d\n\nTwo Russian Raptor-class patrol boats were destroyed early Monday near Snake Island in the Black Sea, the Ukrainian military said. On the Telegram messaging app, it posted what appeared to be drone footage of one of the vessels taking a direct hit, but the video\u2019s authenticity could not immediately be confirmed.\n\nFor its part, Russia said its warplanes struck 38 Ukrainian targets, including concentrations of troops and weapons, over the last 24 hours. A spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry said that an airstrike also destroyed an ammunition depot in the Zaporizhzhia region and that a Ukrainian MiG-29 fighter jet was downed near the eastern town of Slovyansk. The claims could not be independently verified.\n\nThe British Defense Ministry said a quarter of Russian troops dispatched to Ukraine are now \u201ccombat ineffective,\u201d meaning that they are unable to complete their mission because of casualties and equipment losses.\n\nThe ministry said 65% of Russia\u2019s combat forces have been assigned to Ukraine since the war began, with some of the greatest setbacks hitting the best-trained units. \u201cIt will probably take years for Russia to reconstitute these forces,\u201d it said.\n\nStill, much of Ukraine has remained on alert, including the relatively peaceful western city of Lviv, a transit point for refugees fleeing west and a center for humanitarian aid.\n\nAir-raid sirens regularly blast in the city, as in other regions of the nation. Over the weekend, a video went viral of actor Angelina Jolie \u2014 a special envoy of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees \u2014 meeting orphans in Lviv as sirens blared in the background.\n\nIn Odesa, a southwestern city that borders Moldova, fears have grown over increasing attacks as Moscow attempts to take Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea coast, in a move that would connect Russia, Russia-controlled Crimea and a pro-Russia separatist region in Moldova.\n\nIn a Telegram post Monday, regional government spokesman Serhiy Bratchuk said that a key bridge on the Dniester estuary had been hit \u2014 for the third time. Over the weekend, Russia also said it had taken aim at an airport outside the city, leaving it non-functional.\n\nKing reported from Lviv and Kaleem from London.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-05-01/ukraine-garrison-church", "https://www.latimes.com/world-nation", "https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-04-29/ukraine-traitors-helping-russian-troops", "https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-04-29/why-us-needs-a-law-to-sell-off-oligarchs-assets"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": "955126e9226c4d328ac074b0593f79cf", "name": "Jaweed Kaleem"}, {"id": "81a3adf893194a7ab5f5b262516d7a28", "name": "Laura King"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "eastern Ukraine", "weight": 0.069860816}, {"name": "Ukrainian fighters", "weight": 0.068968356}, {"name": "Ukrainian forces", "weight": 0.06885258}, {"name": "Russia", "weight": 0.06738246}, {"name": "Ukrainian refugees", "weight": 0.066610456}, {"name": "Ukraine", "weight": 0.063760616}, {"name": "Ukrainian", "weight": 0.061379}, {"name": "other regions", "weight": 0.060271528}, {"name": "early Monday", "weight": 0.055103537}, {"name": "Monday", "weight": 0.054506995}], "topics": [{"name": "Nancy Pelosi"}, {"name": "Russia-Ukraine War"}], "categories": [{"name": "Politics"}], "entities": [{"data": "Kyiv", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Poland", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Mariupol", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "San Francisco", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Warsaw", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "America", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "U.S.", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Ukraine", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 12}, {"data": "Russia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 11}, {"data": "Zaporizhzhia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Azovstal", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Donbas", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Luhansk", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Belarus", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Moscow", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Kharkiv", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Slovyansk", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Lviv", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Odesa", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Moldova", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Crimea", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "London", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "House", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "The United Nations", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "State", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Defense", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "U.N.", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Telegram", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Nancy Pelosi", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Andrzej Duda", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Volodymyr Zelensky", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Petro Andryushchenko", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Denys Shlega", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Vladimir Putin", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Angelina Jolie", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "pro-Russia", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Serhiy Bratchuk", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "King", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Kaleem", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ukrainians", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 9}, {"data": "Russian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "D", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Democrats", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Polish", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "the Sea of Azov", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Snake Island", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Black Sea", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Dniester", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "nightly", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "overnight", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "morning", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "early Monday", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the last 24 hours", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Azovstal", "type": "FAC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Raptor", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "MiG-29", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.041671302, "negative": 0.7900736, "neutral": 0.16825515}, "summary": "The world body is also assisting Monday with a second day of evacuations from the southern city of Mariupol, where at least hundreds of people have been surrounded by Russian troops in a sprawling steel plant that has become the last redoubt of Ukrainian forces and some civilians.

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nA rate increase\u2026 and then what? The Federal Reserve is meeting this week. The economy is running hot, and the Fed is trying to slow it down before widespread price pressures become even more of a problem. It lifted interest rates in March for the first time since 2018, by a quarter of a percentage point, and has set the stage for an even larger increase of half a percentage point this week. The announcement is expected to come at the conclusion of the Fed\u2019s two-day policy meeting on Wednesday afternoon. But while the rate decision is unlikely to be a surprise, economists and investors will want to know how the Fed plans to move forward at a time when inflation is rising faster than it has in decades. The recent performance of the stock market, which in April took its biggest monthly dive in two years, is hinting at economic trouble ahead, and is the latest complication in the Fed\u2019s fight against inflation. The outlook for inflation is wildly uncertain, report The Times\u2019s Jeanna Smialek and Ben Casselman. On one hand, the Fed\u2019s small rate increase has already pushed mortgage rates sharply higher, which may start to weigh on the housing market and cool off related types of demand. Nonetheless, costs for raw materials and other key inputs continue to climb, and may keep doing so amid the war in Ukraine and lockdowns in China. Already, some companies, like the washing-machine maker Whirlpool, are seeing consumer demand wane compared with last year, though it is still higher than before the pandemic. \u201cHistoric levels of inflation, notably in raw materials, energy and logistics, will impact us throughout the year,\u201d James W. Peters, Whirlpool\u2019s chief financial officer, said last week in a conference call. Americans have been feeling the pain of higher prices, even if they are spending through it. A record share of people in a Gallup poll named inflation as the top U.S. economic problem, survey data released last week showed. Officials spent much of 2021 hoping that pandemic-era cost increases would fade as supply chains returned to normal. Instead, inflation has remained too high for the Fed\u2019s comfort for a year, and it has become broader with time. A higher-than-expected jump in wage data released Friday made a second big increase in June more likely \u201cat the margin,\u201d wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway, the investing conglomerate run by the billionaire and investment legend Warren Buffett, held its annual meeting in person over the weekend after a two-year pandemic hiatus. Andrew was on hand at the event, which drew thousands of people to Berkshire\u2019s hometown, Omaha, and has this dispatch. Warren Buffett, 91, and his longtime business partner Charlie Munger, 98, lobbed quips and retorts over the course of more than six hours onstage at what some call \u201cWoodstock for Capitalists,\u201d speaking and fielding questions. In the audience were Tim Cook, Jamie Dimon, Bill Gates, Bill Ackman, Mario Gabelli, Bill Murray and Glenn Close. Ken Chenault was there as a first-time board member. The big difference this year was the presence of Ajit Jain and Greg Abel, Buffett\u2019s successors, who sat on the dais with him and Munger for the first time. Jain was particularly Buffett-like in the straightforward and analytical way he answered questions, at one point admitting that Geico, the car insurer owned by Berkshire, had underperformed its rival Progressive, and explaining why.\n\nThe biggest news was likely that Buffett was arbitraging the Activision deal with Microsoft, betting it will happen, and had significantly increased his bet on the oil industry by buying more shares of the energy giant Chevron in the first quarter. Here are some of the meeting\u2019s best lines:\n\u2022 None \u201cInflation swindles the bond investor too. It swindles the person who keeps their cash under their mattress. It swindles almost everybody,\u201d Buffett said.\n\u2022 None \u201cIf you told me you owned all the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cWhether it goes up or down in the next year, or five or 10 years, I don\u2019t know. But the one thing I\u2019m pretty sure of is that it doesn\u2019t produce anything.\u201d\n\u2022 None \u201cI try to avoid things that are stupid and evil and make me look bad. Bitcoin does all three,\u201d Munger added.\n\u2022 None \u201cIf I were running oil and gas for the U.S., I would leave most of the oil we have here and pay whatever the Arabs charge for their oil and conserve my own,\u201d Munger said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very precious stuff over the next 200 years.\u201d\n\u2022 None \u201cYou ought to be a better person in the second half of your life than the first half,\u201d Buffett said. What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Where is inflation headed? Officials say they do not yet see evidence that rapid inflation is turning into a permanent feature of the economic landscape, even as prices rise very quickly. There are plenty of reasons to believe that the inflationary burst will fade, but some concerning signs suggest it may last. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better. \u201cIn December, Wood described ARKK portfolio as in \u2018deep value\u2019 territory and sent value investors worldwide into spasms of indignation. ARKK\u2019s down another 50% since then, so deeper value-er, I guess.\u201d \u2014 Andrew Beer of the hedge fund tracking firm Dynamic Beta Investments, in a worth-reading tweet thread on the recent poor performance of Ark Innovation ETF, the flagship fund of the star tech-stock investor Cathie Wood. Elon Musk\u2019s financing plan for his buyout of Twitter has broken all the rules. He is putting up far more of his own money than is usual in such a deal; private equity buyers typically use very little of their own cash to pay for an acquisition. Borrowing money is more standard, but Musk is borrowing a lot \u2014 $13 billion in loans would end up on Twitter\u2019s books. The deal may burden Twitter with more debt than it can handle, given its patchy profitability, The Times\u2019s Anupreeta Das and DealBook\u2019s Lauren Hirsch report in a close look at the numbers. And Musk\u2019s push for more \u201cfree speech\u201d on Twitter could hurt advertising income, making it harder for the company to pay off its new debt. It is not too late for Musk to partner with other investors to reduce the amount of his own money in the deal, and this is something he is considering, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. Thoma Bravo, a technology-focused buyout firm, is open to providing some financing. Apollo, an alternative asset manager, also looked at a possible deal where it would extend a loan on preferred terms.\n\nThe stakes are high for both Twitter and Tesla. Because Musk is selling Tesla shares as well as putting them up as collateral for personal loans to raise cash, Tesla\u2019s value would be linked to Twitter\u2019s. This is risky because any difficulties at Twitter could force Musk to sell Tesla stock and put the money into Twitter.

Belarusian Sabalenka reached the semifinals at Wimbledon last year. Murray, who is donating all of his prize money this season to humanitarian relief in Ukraine, said that he was \"not supportive\" of the plan to ban Russian and Belarusian players from Wimbledon but added that there was no \"right answer\" to the difficult situation. \"My understanding of the guidance was that Russians and Belarusians can play if they sign a declaration that they're against the war and against the Russian regime,\" he said to journalists at the Madrid Open. \"I'm not sure how comfortable I would feel if something happened to one of the players or their families (as a result).\" In the days following their invasion of Ukraine, Russia's parliament passed a law mandating jail terms of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally \"fake\" news about the military, greatly increasing the risks for individual Russians speaking out against the war. The current US Open champion, Daniil Medvedev, is unable to compete at WImbledon this year. Djokovic, meanwhile, referenced his exclusion from the Australian Open for not being vaccinated against Covid-19 as he voiced his opposition to the ban for a second time \"It's not the same thing, but going through something similar earlier this year for myself, it's frustrating knowing that you're not able to play,\" Djokovic said. \"I still stand by my position that I don't support the (Wimbledon) decision. I think it's just not fair, it's not right, but it is what it is.\" Following criticism from the tennis world, the AELTC defended their decision in a press conference last week. \"Even if we were to accept entries from Russian and Belarusian players with written declarations, we would risk their success or participation at Wimbledon being used to benefit the propaganda machine of the Russian regime, which we could not accept,\" tournament chairman Ian Hewitt told reporters last Tuesday.

The June hearings will involve laying out \u201cwhat led to January 6, the lies after the election, fundraising, the 187 minutes the president basically sat in the Oval Office [as the Capitol was attacked] \u2026 the response by [the Department of Defense],\u201d he said.\n\nTrump or no Trump: Asa Hutchinson mulls run for president in 2024\n\nThe Arkansas governor, Asa Hutchinson, is considering a run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024 and would not be deterred if Donald Trump made an expected bid to return to the White House.\n\n\u201cNo, it won\u2019t [deter me],\u201d Hutchinson told CNN\u2019s State of the Union yesterday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made it clear.

DeSantis and Asa Hutchinson could be rivals for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.\n\u2022 None Laine Hardy, who tasted superstardom by winning American Idol, has been arrested after allegedly spying on a woman. A college student in Hardy\u2019s home state, Louisiana, looked under her dormitory bed, found a hidden audio recording device and told police she feared the musician planted it there.\n\nStat of the day: A million acres have already burned across the country as the south-west braces for wildfire season\n\nHot, dry winds will continue to spur flames burning through the drought-stricken landscapes in the south-west and the American plains, complicating efforts to extinguish roughly a dozen destructive wildfires that have already driven thousands from their homes. Risks are usually higher in the region during this time of year and fire conditions typically ramp up in the months sandwiched between winter and summer rain seasons. But experts say the explosive start is an indication of what\u2019s to come in the warming months.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this: Olivia Wilde was served papers onstage. It\u2019s no shock to those in the business\n\nThe actor Olivia Wilde was discussing a forthcoming film on stage this week when she was served papers onstage. The envelope contained custody papers from her ex-fiance, Jason Sudeikis, with whom she has two kids. Wilde reportedly didn\u2019t bat an eye after opening the papers, but the incident sparked questions. How did the person who served the papers get into the event at CinemaCon, a star-studded film industry gathering in Las Vegas? And why did the person choose such a public moment to hand the documents to Wilde?\n\nClimate check: Rob Bilott on his 20-year fight against forever chemicals\n\nLast month, an Ohio court certified a class action lawsuit brought by lawyer Rob Bilott that would cover 7 million people \u2013 and at some point possibly everyone living in the US \u2013 who have been exposed to certain hazardous \u201cforever chemicals\u201d known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances or PFAS. The chemicals have been linked to cancer, birth defects, kidney disease and a range of other human health problems. They are called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not naturally break down, persisting indefinitely in the environment.\n\nLast Thing: Florida couple call for help after can-do alligator has a Diet Coke break\n\nA gregarious Florida alligator seemingly could not wait for a family\u2019s birthday party to begin, so it slipped into a garage where supplies were being stored and chugged down a slab of Diet Coke. The uninvited guest surprised Naples homeowners Karyn and Jamie Dobson when they opened the connecting door from their house after hearing a crash, WINK News reported. \u201cI open the door about a quarter way, peek my head in, and there\u2019s the alligator,\u201d Jamie Dobson said. He said the 8ft crocodilian was backing away, with froth from the cans all over the floor.\n\nFirst Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nIf imports end because of the war, American companies may look to increase domestic mining, which has a toxic history on Indigenous lands.\n\nKAIBAB NATIONAL FOREST, Ariz. \u2014 After Russia invaded Ukraine in February, the United States slapped bans on Russian energy sources from oil to coal. But one critical Russian energy import was left alone: uranium, which the United States relies on to fuel more than 90 nuclear reactors around the country. That dependence on Russia is breathing life into ambitions to resurrect the uranium industry around the American West \u2014 and also evoking fears of the industry\u2019s toxic legacy of pollution. With some of the most coveted uranium lodes found around Indigenous lands, the moves are setting up clashes between mining companies and energy security hawks on one side and tribal nations and environmentalists on the other. Arizona\u2019s Pinyon Plain Mine, situated less than 10 miles from the Grand Canyon\u2019s southern rim, is emerging as ground zero for such conflicts. The Havasupai Tribe, whose people have lived in the canyonlands and plateaus of the Grand Canyon since time immemorial, call the area of the mining site Mat Taav Tiijundva \u2014 \u201cSacred Meeting Place\u201d in a rough translation.\n\nBut since Russia\u2019s invasion, mining executives have seen the site as something else: the tip of the spear in their jostling to advance American uranium projects. \u201cWe have the ability to reduce dependence on Russian uranium right now,\u201d said Mark Chalmers, chief executive of Energy Fuels, the Colorado company that owns Pinyon Plain and is fighting in court to ramp up uranium production. The Grand Canyon went through a uranium mining boom in the 1950s that ebbed by the 1980s, when Pinyon Plain was built. Near Havasupai burial sites, and targeted by legal battles nearly since its inception, the mine has never been fully operational. But the mine produces water heavy in arsenic and uranium as a result of drilling several years ago that punctured an aquifer, provoking fears that the site could contaminate Havasupai water supplies. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to use this war as an excuse to advance this project,\u201d said Stuart Chavez, a member of the Havasupai Tribal Council, about the Pinyon Plain Mine, which is one of numerous already permitted uranium sites in states including Arizona, Utah and Wyoming that could quickly increase activity if sanctions are levied on Russian uranium. He contends the United States could turn to Canada or other friendly nations to make up for Russian uranium if the imports end.\n\nLeaders in the American uranium industry, which has largely been in a slump since the 1990s, are seizing the moment even as resistance to their plans emerges in various parts of the West. Talking about Indigenous leaders and environmental groups opposing the mining resurgence, Mr. Chalmers, the mining executive, said: \u201cA lot of them would rather get uranium from Russia than mine our own.\u201d The Russian uranium imports originated in the Cold War\u2019s aftermath. Aiming to curb the risk of nuclear war, the United States struck a deal in 1992 to buy enriched uranium that had been used in thousands of scrapped Russian nuclear warheads. Called Megatons to Megawatts, the nonproliferation program lasted until 2013. Still, even when Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and went on to invade Ukraine this year, the United States kept importing large quantities of Russian uranium. As the Russian uranium sales took hold, the American uranium industry idled mines around the West, a result of the collapse of prices after the end of the Cold War arms race and of a slowdown in construction of new nuclear plans. Now the industry is finding powerful support in Washington. Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, a Republican, introduced a bill in March to ban Russian uranium imports partly as a way to revive American mines. Legislators in the House of Representatives, including Representative Henry Cuellar of Texas, a Democrat, introduced their own bipartisan bill in March calling for a ban.\n\n\u201cA robust domestic supply chain for nuclear fuel has never been more important for our nuclear fleet,\u201d Scott Melbye, the president of the Uranium Producers of America, a trade group, said in testimony before the Senate in March. \u201cThe sooner we decouple our nuclear industry from Russia, the sooner Western nuclear markets can get to work to fill the gap.\u201d The measures haven\u2019t advanced in the Democratic-controlled chambers in large part because the United States still relies so heavily on Russian uranium. While energy sources like wind and solar are gaining ground, nuclear power comprises about 19 percent of the electricity produced in the United States, the world\u2019s largest uranium consumer. Plans for a new generation of advanced nuclear reactors, a potentially crucial source of carbon-free energy that the United States needs to reach climate goals, also depend heavily on Russia, which holds what some call a monopoly on the enriched uranium needed to fuel such projects.\n\nA proposal for an emergency stockpile of uranium, supplied by mines in the United States, is also raising alarm even if sanctions on Russian uranium fail to materialize. The idea of a Strategic Uranium Reserve, a concept that originated during the Trump administration, is being examined by the Department of Energy and drawing some prominent support in Congress. It would require the federal government to purchase uranium \u201cnewly-produced in the U.S. from deposits at an existing site\u201d such as Pinyon Plain. \u201cThe possibility that this mine could go forward is unthinkable under an administration that has made promises to prioritize environmental justice,\u201d said Amber Reimondo, energy director at the nonprofit Grand Canyon Trust. As nuclear power companies seek ways to expand mining and jump-start the enrichment supply-chain in the United States, opponents of Pinyon Plain warn it could produce an outcome similar to the hundreds of abandoned uranium mines still emitting dangerous radiation levels on Indigenous lands.\n\n\u201cThis specific site is sacred for us, dotted with burial places and remains of homes and sweat lodges,\u201d said Carletta Tilousi, a former Havasupai tribal council member who has been fighting the mine for decades. Like other uranium projects around the country, activity at the mine was suspended in the 1990s when uranium prices crashed. But the mine\u2019s owners managed to advance the project, even after the Obama administration announced a 20-year ban in 2012 on new uranium mining around the Grand Canyon. Owners of the mine, which was grandfathered in before the moratorium, have prevailed in one legal challenge after another. In February, a federal appeals court sided with the U.S. Forest Service in a ruling against the Havasupai and three environmental groups seeking to prevent the mine from operating. Mr. Chalmers, of Energy Fuels, called the ruling a victory for energy security, contending that the mine had enough uranium to provide the entire state of Arizona with electricity for one year. \u201cIt\u2019s the highest-grade uranium mine in the United States,\u201d said Mr. Chalmers, who has extensive experience in Australia and former Soviet republics. Eying uranium prices, which have shot up more than 30 percent since the war flared up, he also said that Energy Fuels was close to negotiating contracts to supply uranium to nuclear power plant operators in the United States. At the same time, he argued that the mine would not be harmful to the Havasupai.\n\nDavid Kreamer, a professor of hydrology and an authority on groundwater contaminants at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, disputed that assertion. \u201cI\u2019m all for mining if it\u2019s done responsibly with proper safeguards,\u201d Mr. Kreamer said. But he called Pinyon Plain a potential \u201ctime bomb\u201d that could have detrimental effects in a decade or so. Mr. Kreamer said he was especially concerned about drilling activity at the mine that pierced an aquifer several years ago, releasing millions of gallons of water high in both uranium and arsenic. To prevent the water from contaminating nearby areas, Energy Fuels is collecting it in a pool at the mine, where some of it evaporates. The company has also trucked the water nearly 250 miles to White Mesa, Utah, where the company owns the country\u2019s only fully licensed and operating conventional uranium mill. The Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, whose members live near the White Mesa site, called last year for the mill to close. In correspondence this year with Arizona regulators, Scott Bakken, vice president for regulatory affairs at Energy Fuels, said the company was also measuring the daily volume and conducting periodic sampling of the water pumped to the surface. Mr. Bakken added that Energy Fuels would increase the frequency of pumping to mitigate any risk to groundwater if water quality standards are not met. The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality on Thursday gave the company the green light to continue, moving to grant an aquifer protection permit to Energy Fuels. The ruling, which is the latest stamp of regulatory guidance for the project, allows the company to use engineering controls to \u201creduce discharge of pollutants to the greatest degree achievable,\u201d the agency said. But members of the Havasupai Tribe, as well as hydrologists such as Mr. Kreamer, are also expressing concern that the uranium-heavy water released by the aquifer, despite the company\u2019s efforts to collect it, could jeopardize the supply of water to nearby Supai Village, home to Havasupai families, and springs within the Grand Canyon itself.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re setting up conditions that would mobilize the contaminants,\u201d Mr. Kreamer said. Noting how Pinyon Plain is steadily advancing, Ms. Tilousi, of the Havasupai Tribe, said, \u201cThe domestic uranium industry is set to go into overdrive again.\u201d \u201cBut we\u2019ll lie down in front of the mine\u2019s entrance to keep it from fully functioning if we have to,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019ll make them understand this is about much more than money.\u201d", "medium":

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe women say they were forced onto a bus to Russian-controlled territory, then escaped what Ukrainian and U.S. officials have described as \u201cfiltration\u201d centers for a system of forced expulsions to Russia.\n\nVera and Nicole thought they had endured the worst of the war as Russia besieged their city, Mariupol, for weeks. The sisters helped neighbors bury neighbors, melted snow for drinking water and survived a bombardment that tore a hole in the ceiling of their home. But by mid-March, they knew it was time to leave. They heard that the Russian invaders were sweeping the southern port city and transferring Ukrainians by bus either to Russia or to Russian-controlled territory. The sisters took Vera\u2019s 4-year-old son, Kirill, slipped out of Mariupol on foot and embarked on a harrowing journey. They said they crossed a heavily mined road strewn with corpses; encountered a Russian sniper near a church who waved them on; and survived an artillery barrage in a field of flowers. After two days, the trio staggered onto a highway, only to be met by a Russian soldier who directed them to a packed bus.\n\nThe bus took them to a school in the nearby town of Nikolske, which they said had been converted into a Russian-operated registration center where Ukrainians were filling out forms with their personal information. That was their first brush with what Ukrainian and U.S. officials and human rights groups have called \u201cfiltration\u201d centers that they say are part of a system of forced expulsions of Ukrainians to Russia. Forced population transfers and so-called \u201cfiltration\u201d are tactics that were used by Russia during the Chechen wars in the 1990s, according to Frederick W. Kagan, a senior fellow and director of the Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute. He said the strategy was to terrify the population into submission, keep control over witnesses to atrocities and separate out anyone seen as resistant to a Russian takeover. The story of Vera and Nicole, who asked that their last names not be used for fear of Russian reprisals, first came to light when they contacted a British humanitarian organization, United with Ukraine, which has been working to get aid to Mariupol since March. The group arranged contact with The New York Times. The sisters, who say they are telling their story to show the world what is happening in Russian-controlled territory, have also spoken to other news media outlets. They shared videos and a diary with The Times chronicling their life in Mariupol and part of their escape from the city, which has now fallen almost entirely under Russian control.\n\nRachel Denber, the Human Rights Watch deputy director for Europe and Central Asia, said the group had documented two witness accounts of being taken to filtration centers and said Russia\u2019s actions \u201cbore all the hallmarks of a forced transfer.\u201d She added that the Fourth Geneva Convention, to which Russia is a signatory, prohibits the forcible transfer of civilians from occupied territories, which would make such forced transfers a war crime. Nicole, right, with Kirill on their journey out of Russian-controlled territory last month, in a photo provided by the sisters. \u201cWe can\u2019t discount the fact that there might be people who made an informed choice to go to Russia,\u201d Ms. Denber said. But, she said, other Ukrainians \u201care leaving because they have no other choice than to either go to the occupying power or die.\u201d The roads out of Russian-held territory are also notoriously dangerous in places. Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, Sergiy Kyslytsya, told the Security Council recently that there were filtration centers in three Russian-controlled towns \u2014 Nikolske, Manhush and Yalta. All three, like Mariupol, are part of the Donetsk region, which borders Russia. Vera and Nicole said they stayed briefly in filtration centers in two of those three towns during their escape from Mariupol. The two centers that Vera and Nicole passed through in Nikolske and Manhush were not heavily guarded and some there were given the option to stay or go, they said. But they said it wasn\u2019t much of a choice: The Russians were offering safe passage in one direction only, and it wasn\u2019t to Ukrainian-held territory.\n\n\u201cFor some, their houses were destroyed and there was nowhere to go,\u201d said Vera. \u201cOthers were there to save their children. This was the only safe option left to them.\u201d May 2, 2022, 4:59 a.m. ET\n\u2022 Britain says that 1 in 4 Russian invasion units is now \u2018combat ineffective.\u2019\n\u2022 The first evacuees from Mariupol reach relative safety.\n\u2022 Here are the latest developments in the war in Ukraine. Tatyana Moskalkova, Russia\u2019s commissioner for human rights, has denied that Ukrainians were being forcibly transferred to Russia. President Vladimir V. Putin says that about a million Ukrainians have been taken to Russia, but he describes the movement as evacuations. The Russian authorities have described the invasion of Ukraine as a necessary mission to assist their ethnic kin who they say faced discrimination. They have portrayed efforts to bring people displaced from the east of Ukraine to Russia as a humanitarian operation to save them from the Ukrainian authorities.\n\nVera and Nicole\u2019s ordeal began around the middle of March, when Russian soldiers were tightening their grip on Mariupol. Nicole said she had heard a radio report saying the International Committee of the Red Cross had begun evacuating people from the outskirts of the city. \u201cWe were terrified,\u201d said Nicole, 21. \u201cBut each day we waited, we knew it was getting more difficult to leave.\u201d Pelosi\u2019s visit. In a sign of the United States\u2019 deepening commitment to Ukraine, Speaker Nancy Pelosi became the most senior American official to visit Kyiv, meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky and vowing to back Ukraine \u201cuntil victory is won.\u201d Mariupol evacuation. The long-awaited rescue of civilians from a sprawling steel plant in Mariupol is underway, according to Ukrainian officials and the United Nations. Mr. Zelensky said that about 100 civilians were being evacuated and are heading to a \u201ccontrolled area.\u201d Russian oil embargo. European Union countries are likely to approve a phased embargo on Russian oil, sealing a long-postponed measure that has divided the bloc\u2019s members and highlighted their dependence on Russian energy sources. E.U. ambassadors expect to give their final approval by the end of the week, officials said. They decided to risk it, even if it meant leaving members of their family behind. They said goodbye to their brother, who feared that if he left with them, he might be stopped by Russian soldiers who had reportedly been strip-searching men of military age, checking evidence of service or training, such as tattoos or calluses on their trigger fingers. Their mother, who had been separated from them since the start of the invasion, would not even know they had left.\n\nStill, when a Ukrainian man entered the school and offered them a free ride to Berdyansk, near the Russian border \u2014 one of the first cities seized by Russia in the war \u2014 the sisters took the chance. Even though they would still be in Russian-controlled territory when they got there, they reasoned that it was better to keep moving. Also, they had a relative in Berdyansk. \u201cI don\u2019t know what would have happened had that man had not walked into our lives at that moment,\u201d Nicole said. From Berdyansk, the sisters boarded an evacuation van that was part of a humanitarian corridor to Zaporizhzhia in southeastern Ukraine. They knew they had reached Ukrainian-held territory when they saw bright yellow municipal buses on the roads. \u201cWe stood in the street and started to cry,\u201d said Vera. \u201cI never thought the sight of a bus could make me so happy.\u201d", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/01/world/europe/mariupol-steel-plant-evacuation.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-russia-ukraine&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/05/02/world/ukraine-russia-war-news#the-first-evacuees-from-mariupol-reach-relative-safety", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/world/europe/russia-chechnya-grozny-ukraine.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/05/01/world/ukraine-russia-war-news/pelosi-and-democratic-lawmakers-vow-the-us-will-stand-with-ukraine?smid=url-copy&action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-russia-ukraine&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/05/02/world/ukraine-russia-war-news#britain-says-that-1-in-4-russian-invasion-units-is-now-combat-ineffective", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/14/world/europe/european-union-oil-embargo-russia-ukraine.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-russia-ukraine&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/04/29/world/ukraine-russia-war-news/europe-ratchets-up-preparation-for-russian-oil-embargo-next-week?smid=url-copy&action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-russia-ukraine&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/05/02/world/ukraine-russia-war-news#here-are-the-latest-developments-in-the-war-in-ukraine"], "labels": [], "matchedAuthors": [{"id": null, "name": "Cora Engelbrecht"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Russia", "weight": 0.07245457}, {"name": "Russian soldiers", "weight": 0.07071271}, {"name": "Russian control", "weight": 0.06903486}, {"name": "Russian energy sources", "weight": 0.066899605}, {"name": "Russian oil", "weight": 0.0667773}, {"name": "Mariupol evacuation", "weight": 0.06663397}, {"name": "Russian", "weight": 0.066382706}, {"name": "Russian reprisals", "weight": 0.06572131}, {"name": "Russian oil embargo", "weight": 0.06503157}, {"name": "filtration centers", "weight": 0.061870966}], "topics": [{"name": "Europe"}, {"name": "Russia-Ukraine War"}], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "Russian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 23}, {"data": "Ukrainian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 13}, {"data": "Chechen", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "British", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "American", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "U.S.", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Russia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 14}, {"data": "Mariupol", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 10}, {"data": "Nikolske", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Ukraine", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 7}, {"data": "Manhush", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Yalta", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Donetsk", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Britain", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the United States\u2019", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Kyiv", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Berdyansk", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Zaporizhzhia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Vera", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 8}, {"data": "Nicole", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 9}, {"data": "Kirill", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Frederick W.
